The GTN wants you to be able to rely on our URLs once you’ve added them to a poster or training material, without having to worry about them breaking in the future.</p>

<p>For a long time we relied on contributors ensuring that when files are merged, we add appropriate redirects to each moved file, however this isn’t a very reliable system.
We’d recently also introduced <a href="/training-material/news/2023/04/19/shortlinks.html">Persistent URLs (PURLs) to our lessons as well</a> but that only helps our users going forward, it doesn’t ensure we are meeting our earlier commitments.</p>

<p>So now we’ve added a new test to each GTN merge that checks URLs from the last 3 years to ensure that they are <em>all</em> still working.
If they aren’t, the merge will fail and the contributor will need to fix the URLs before the changes can be accepted.</p>

<p>We’ll be expanding how far back we check URLs in the future, but for now, this will help us ensure that our URLs are completely persistent!</p>

<p>By implementing this we discovered only 50 pages (out of ~5.3k GTN pages) that had been moved without proper redirections, and we’ve fixed them all!</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn infrastructure" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Galaxy Training Network we are really committed to ensuring our training materials are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

<h1 id="generic-model-organism-database">Generic Model Organism Database</h1>

<blockquote class="quote" cite="http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page">
  <p>the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, a collection of open source software tools for managing, visualising, storing, and disseminating genetic and genomic data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Galaxy Project itself has long been a GMOD component, but you’ll recognise some other familiar faces there as well, if you are interested in Genome Annotation. JBrowse, used throughout the GTN in a number of tutorials to render genomic data, and Apollo are both members that you’ll find tutorials for within the GTN.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>As such we’ve created a new topic to help aggregate all of the GMOD related material together. This currently includes tutorials on the use of <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-jbrowse1">JBrowse</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-apollo2">Apollo</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-intermine">InterMine</a>, and <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-maker">MAKER</a>!</p>

<p>For teachers, tag based topics now support a second level of organisation, in ‘subtopics’. We’ve used that to add a new topic, using subtopics to organise each GMOD component.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>For now the topic includes all GTN tutorials which use a GMOD component (that isn’t galaxy), all of these tutorials generally also include Galaxy based steps. In the future we may expand this to include tutorials for other GMOD components which don’t necessary interface with Galaxy. <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/" class="contributor-badge-inline contributor-hexylena">

the luxury of your pocket?</p>

<p>Now you can, with <strong>Galaxy In Your Pocket™!</strong></p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Run your instance without having to worry about the usual concerns: a
noisy server, too many cables, bad internet, or just a plain
unwillingness to spend time away from a screen.</p>

<p>Having <em>Galaxy In Your Pocket™</em>, you can run and administer your own
instance all from the same portable device that you use to ignore your
loved ones with!</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3644481">just a few steps</a>, you
can have Galaxy running on a mobile ARM device of your own.</p>

<p>Now a nightmare of switching between single cell datatypes or importing the data is gone! With the new section on Changing data formats &amp; preparing objects, the users can now confidently jump into the analysis. Some of those tutorials were created in the framework of ELIXIR-UK: FAIR Data Stewardship training, which aims to improve Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable (FAIR) data management in the life sciences.</p>

<p>We have developed the following tutorials:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-data-ingest/tutorial.html">Converting between common single cell data formats</a></li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/EBI-retrieval/tutorial.html">Importing files for single cell analysis from public atlases</a></li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-ncbi-anndata/tutorial.html">Converting NCBI Data to the AnnData Format</a></li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/bulk-music-2-preparescref/tutorial.html">Creating a single-cell RNA-seq reference dataset for deconvolution</a></li>
  <li><a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/bulk-music-3-preparebulk/tutorial.html">Creating the bulk RNA-seq dataset for deconvolution</a></li>
</ul>
