This means that we want to make sure that the URLs to our training materials are persistent and don’t change.
The GTN wants you to be able to rely on our URLs once you’ve added them to a poster or training material, without having to worry about them breaking in the future.</p>

<p>For a long time we relied on contributors ensuring that when files are merged, we add appropriate redirects to each moved file, however this isn’t a very reliable system.
We’d recently also introduced <a href="/training-material/news/2023/04/19/shortlinks.html">Persistent URLs (PURLs) to our lessons as well</a> but that only helps our users going forward, it doesn’t ensure we are meeting our earlier commitments.</p>

<p>So now we’ve added a new test to each GTN merge that checks URLs from the last 3 years to ensure that they are <em>all</em> still working.
If they aren’t, the merge will fail and the contributor will need to fix the URLs before the changes can be accepted.</p>

<p>We’ll be expanding how far back we check URLs in the future, but for now, this will help us ensure that our URLs are completely persistent!</p>

<p>By implementing this we discovered only 50 pages (out of ~5.3k GTN pages) that had been moved without proper redirections, and we’ve fixed them all!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn infrastructure" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Galaxy Training Network we are really committed to ensuring our training materials are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

<p>In order to make it easier for you to find your way, we have started highlighting a number of our <strong>Learning Paths</strong> which are like guided tours through the GTN’s content. They are designed to help you learn a topic from start to finish, and are a great way to get a comprehensive understanding of a topic.</p>

<p>Check them out now!</p>

<h1 id="generic-model-organism-database">Generic Model Organism Database</h1>

<blockquote class="quote" cite="http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page">
  <p>the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, a collection of open source software tools for managing, visualising, storing, and disseminating genetic and genomic data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Galaxy Project itself has long been a GMOD component, but you’ll recognise some other familiar faces there as well, if you are interested in Genome Annotation. JBrowse, used throughout the GTN in a number of tutorials to render genomic data, and Apollo are both members that you’ll find tutorials for within the GTN.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>As such we’ve created a new topic to help aggregate all of the GMOD related material together. This currently includes tutorials on the use of <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-jbrowse1">JBrowse</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-apollo2">Apollo</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-intermine">InterMine</a>, and <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-maker">MAKER</a>!</p>

<p>For teachers, tag based topics now support a second level of organisation, in ‘subtopics’. We’ve used that to add a new topic, using subtopics to organise each GMOD component.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>For now the topic includes all GTN tutorials which use a GMOD component (that isn’t galaxy), all of these tutorials generally also include Galaxy based steps. In the future we may expand this to include tutorials for other GMOD components which don’t necessary interface with Galaxy. <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/" class="contributor-badge-inline contributor-hexylena">

Have you ever wanted to administer your own instance from
the luxury of your pocket?</p>

<p>Now you can, with <strong>Galaxy In Your Pocket™!</strong></p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Run your instance without having to worry about the usual concerns: a
noisy server, too many cables, bad internet, or just a plain
unwillingness to spend time away from a screen.</p>

<p>Having <em>Galaxy In Your Pocket™</em>, you can run and administer your own
instance all from the same portable device that you use to ignore your
loved ones with!</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/3644481">just a few steps</a>, you
can have Galaxy running on a mobile ARM device of your own.</p>

<figure id="figure-1" style="max-width: 90%;"><img src="/training-material/news/images/2024-01-31-postmarket-phone.jpg" alt="Galaxy running on an Alcatel Idol 347. " width="1816" height="1435" loading="lazy" /><a target="_blank" href="/training-material/news/images/2024-01-31-postmarket-phone.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Galaxy running on an Alcatel Idol 347</figcaption></figure>

<p>Above is an image of Galaxy running within
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Phosh">Phosh UI</a> in <em>PostmarketOS</em> on an old
<a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Alcatel_Idol_3_4.7%22_(alcatel-idol347)">Alcatel Idol 347</a>,
using a Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and 1.3GB of RAM, with a 5GB swap mounted.</p>

<p>Galaxy appears to use around ~1 GB RAM, and the phone still has enough
memory to spare to access the Galaxy UI via Firefox.</p>

<h2 id="really-why">Really, why?</h2>

<p>Just imagine: <em>Galaxy In Your Pocket™</em>! A united Galaxy Client and
Galaxy Server running on your phone 📲, which you can then access using
that same phone’s web browser.</p>

<p>It’s the perfect setup that only a <em>true and dedicated</em> Galaxy Admin
such as yourself can dream about.</p>

<p>Or if you’re not buying any of this, then it’s for those emergency
situations where you forgot your laptop and need to solve a bioinformatics crisis on the go 🧬🌄</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news" /><category term="fun" /><category term="system administrators" /><category term="developers" /><category term="humour" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Galaxy admins!
