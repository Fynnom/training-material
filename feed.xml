<p>The investigation of environmental microbial communities and microbiomes has been revolutionized by the development of high-throughput amplicon sequencing. In amplicon sequencing a particular genetic locus, for example the 16S rRNA gene (or a part of it) in bacteria, is amplified from DNA extracted from the community of interest, and then sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform. This technique removes the need to culture microbes in order to detect their presence, and cost-effectively provides a deep census of a microbial community.</p>

<p>The GTN loves leveraging existing standards for both old and new purposes. One of our favourite standards that we adhere to is providing an RSS/Atom news feed for sharing news and events and updates!</p>

<h2 id="why-rssatom">Why RSS/Atom?</h2>

<p>RSS feeds provide access to the latest news and updates from websites. They are a great way to keep up to date with your favourite websites without having to visit them every day, and without having to sign up for a mailing list or social media account. You can subscribe to feeds using a <a href="https://aboutfeeds.com/">feed reader</a>, which will automatically check for updates and display them for you.</p>

<p>There are some other benefits of RSS feeds however:</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

<p>Our feed subscriptions are completely private! We do not need a mailing list or any other personal information to send you updates. You can subscribe to our feed and receive updates without us knowing anything about you. You can subscribe or unsubscribe at any time.</p>

<h3 id="standards">Standards</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)">Atom feeds</a> (similar to the more well known RSS feeds) are a well-established standard (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287">IETF RFC 4287</a>) for ‘news’ type feeds. This means that we can easily integrate with other systems that understand Atom feeds! Any feed reader you choose will be able to understand our feed.</p>

<p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=http%3A//training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/feed.xml">
  <img src="/training-material/assets/images/valid-atom.png" alt="[Valid Atom 1.0]" title="Validate my Atom 1.0 feed" />
</a></p>

<h3 id="environmental-friendliness">Environmental Friendliness</h3>

<p>Feeds are small, lightweight, and easily cached by servers. Our feeds are generated at least once a day and cached aggressively with support for features like ETags and Last-Modified headers. This means that you can subscribe to our feed and receive updates without causing any additional load on our servers. Additionally checking if our feed is updated does not require any computation on our part! We just serve a static file to you.</p>

<h3 id="syndication">Syndication</h3>

<p>This is one of the <em>coolest</em> benefits of standard RSS feeds, we believe: how many other systems interoperate with them! For instance if you wanted to subscribe to GTN news in your Slack channel, you could use the existing <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack">RSS integration</a> to do so without any additional coding or customisation required. Just run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/feed subscribe http://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/feed.xml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you wanted to see the same news in your Matrix channel, you can use one of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/imbev/matrix-rss-bridge">RSS bridges</a> to do so. You’ll get notified of every new post!</p>

<p>We even use this feed to post our updates to the Galaxy Hub</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-feed">What’s in a feed?</h2>

<p>If you’ve never looked at our feed before, we recommend you do, <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/feed.xml">it’s a bit fancier than the average RSS feed</a>! Each news item provides a short preview to let you decide if you’re interested in reading more. If you are, you can click through to the full post on our website.</p>

<h2 id="gtn-feeds">GTN Feeds</h2>

<p>We actually produce a large number of RSS feeds which can let you subscribe to topics you’re interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/feed.xml">News</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/events/feed.xml">Events</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We also produce per-topic feeds if you are just interested in a single topic and want to be informed about new tutorials or slides added to that topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/feed.xml">Galaxy Interface Updates</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/single-cell/feed.xml">Single Cell Updates</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/feed.xml">Fair Training Updates</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These feeds are updated every time we add new content to the GTN, so you can be sure you’re always up to date! You can find their links on every tutorial page.</p>

<h2 id="more-feeds-in-the-future">More Feeds in the Future</h2>

<p>We’re exploring the possibility for ‘tag’ based feeds, where you can subscribe to anything added to our site with a given tag. Say you were interested in genome annotation, with a tag based feed you’d get to hear about any new tutorials, slides, events, FAQs, or news posts added to the GTN with that tag.</p>

<p>On top of that we’re considering producing a ‘daily digest’ feed and potentially a ‘weekly digest’ like we currently create manually for posting to our chat channels in matrix. This would give us a lot more flexibility in how to share our news and updates with you. Perhaps we would also create those digests for specific topics, so you could subscribe to a weekly digest of all new single cell tutorials, for example.</p>

Often times when using a tool, such information can be very useful, but hard to discover.</p>

<p>Galaxy’s new GTN Tool-Form integration helps with this, by connecting Galaxy to the GTN, and displaying all tutorials which make use of the tool you are currently using, directly inside to Tool Form!
This way it is easy to discover practical examples and guides for Tools, general and domain-specific.
The list of tutorials referencing a specific tool can either be viewed on the GTN, or browsed from within the Tool Form.</p>

<p>For an example check out the <a href="https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=cat1">Concatenate Datasets tool</a> hosted on the EU Galaxy server.</p>

<p>If this section does not appear on your Galaxy server, there may be no tutorials available for the tool you are currently using, or this feature may not be enabled.</p>

<p>The GTN integration doesn’t need to use the official GTN. Configuration settings are available to allow it to link to an internal help site or wiki.</p>]]></content><author><name>Laila Los</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="already-on-hub" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many tools in Galaxy, the GTN offers a variety of guides, practical examples, and help throughout it’s many tutorials.

<h2 id="what-is-the-gtn-downloader">What is the GTN Downloader?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gtn-downloader">GTN-Downloader</a> makes it easier for users to access and organize data from the <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy Training Network (GTN)</a>.
The GTN Downloader is a Python script that automates the download of data from GTN tutorials. It goes through the tutorials in the GTN repository, finds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-library.yaml</code> files,
and creates a structured directory based on the tutorial names and file contents.</p>

<h3 id="key-features">Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automated Data Download</strong>: The script finds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-library.yaml</code> files in the GTN repository and downloads the associated data files.</li>
  <li><strong>Structured Organization</strong>: It creates directories based on the tutorial names and the information in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-library.yaml</code> files, so the files are organized.</li>
  <li><strong>Download Summary</strong>: It generates a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">download-summary.tsv</code> file, which includes metadata about the downloaded files, a download report (error, success, already downloaded), and the overall size of the files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="seamless-integration-with-onedata">Seamless Integration with Onedata</h2>

<p>In addition to local downloads, the GTN Downloader can upload data to <a href="https://onedata.org">Onedata</a>, a distributed data management platform. This integration ensures that the latest GTN data is always available to users.</p>

<h3 id="automated-workflow-with-github-cicd">Automated Workflow with GitHub CI/CD:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automated Workflow</strong>: A GitHub Actions workflow runs once a week on weekends to download the latest data from the GTN tutorials and upload it to Onedata.</li>
  <li><strong>Environment Setup</strong>: The workflow sets up necessary environment variables and installs dependencies, including Oneclient, the Onedata POSIX client.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Upload</strong>: After downloading the data, the workflow uploads it to Onedata, making it publicly accessible.</li>
