This means that we want to make sure that the URLs to our training materials are persistent and don‚Äôt change.
The GTN wants you to be able to rely on our URLs once you‚Äôve added them to a poster or training material, without having to worry about them breaking in the future.</p>

<p>For a long time we relied on contributors ensuring that when files are merged, we add appropriate redirects to each moved file, however this isn‚Äôt a very reliable system.
We‚Äôd recently also introduced <a href="/training-material/news/2023/04/19/shortlinks.html">Persistent URLs (PURLs) to our lessons as well</a> but that only helps our users going forward, it doesn‚Äôt ensure we are meeting our earlier commitments.</p>

<p>So now we‚Äôve added a new test to each GTN merge that checks URLs from the last 3 years to ensure that they are <em>all</em> still working.
If they aren‚Äôt, the merge will fail and the contributor will need to fix the URLs before the changes can be accepted.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll be expanding how far back we check URLs in the future, but for now, this will help us ensure that our URLs are completely persistent!</p>

<p>By implementing this we discovered only 50 pages (out of ~5.3k GTN pages) that had been moved without proper redirections, and we‚Äôve fixed them all!</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="gtn infrastructure" /><category term="new feature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the Galaxy Training Network we are really committed to ensuring our training materials are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

<h1 id="generic-model-organism-database">Generic Model Organism Database</h1>

<blockquote class="quote" cite="http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page">
  <p>the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, a collection of open source software tools for managing, visualising, storing, and disseminating genetic and genomic data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Galaxy Project itself has long been a GMOD component, but you‚Äôll recognise some other familiar faces there as well, if you are interested in Genome Annotation. JBrowse, used throughout the GTN in a number of tutorials to render genomic data, and Apollo are both members that you‚Äôll find tutorials for within the GTN.</p>

<h2 id="current-state">Current State</h2>

<p>As such we‚Äôve created a new topic to help aggregate all of the GMOD related material together. This currently includes tutorials on the use of <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-jbrowse1">JBrowse</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-apollo2">Apollo</a>, <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-intermine">InterMine</a>, and <a href="/training-material/topics/gmod/#st-maker">MAKER</a>!</p>

<p>For teachers, tag based topics now support a second level of organisation, in ‚Äòsubtopics‚Äô. We‚Äôve used that to add a new topic, using subtopics to organise each GMOD component.</p>

<h2 id="future">Future</h2>

<p>For now the topic includes all GTN tutorials which use a GMOD component (that isn‚Äôt galaxy), all of these tutorials generally also include Galaxy based steps. In the future we may expand this to include tutorials for other GMOD components which don‚Äôt necessary interface with Galaxy. <a href="/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/" class="contributor-badge-inline contributor-hexylena">

unwillingness to spend time away from a screen.</p>

<p>Having <em>Galaxy In Your Pocket‚Ñ¢</em>, you can run and administer your own
instance all from the same portable device that you use to ignore your
loved ones with!</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

With a commitment to battling work duplication across the multiverse, this community is boldly charting a course for global domination, proving that when it comes to bioinformatics, the Galaxy is the limit!‚ú®</p>

<h1 id="tools--workflows">Tools &amp; Workflows</h1>

<p>The past year has been a spectacular journey in advancing tools and workflows within the Galaxy Single-cell Community. Breaking free from the confines of scRNA-seq, we‚Äôve expanded our horizons to include tools for analyzing data from other modalities such as single-cell ATAC-seq and CITE-Seq. Dive into our updated scRNA-seq analysis tools, now featuring more downstream analysis options for trajectory analysis. We‚Äôve even thrown in advanced analysis tools for estimating cell type proportions from bulk RNA-seq data!</p>

<p><strong>RNA STARSolo</strong> just got a makeover to version 2.7.10b, boasting a revamped UI, Velocyto-like UMI counting, and nifty alternatives for quantifying single nuclei data. Analyzing single-cell ATAC-seq data on Galaxy is now a breeze with the introduction of the <strong>EpiScanpy</strong> tool suite, built on the renowned <strong>Scanpy</strong> toolkit. Plus, we‚Äôve added some powerful tools from the <strong>Sinto</strong> toolkit for preprocessing scATAC-seq data on Galaxy. And that‚Äôs not all! The <strong>MuSiC</strong> tool suite in Galaxy now unveils deconvolution tools for discovering cell type composition in bulk RNA-seq using cell types within scRNA-seq. Multi-faceted comparisons are now at your fingertips with the <strong>MuSiC Compare</strong> tool.</p>

<p>Seurat fans, rejoice! Updates have rolled in, offering additional functionalities and optional CITE-seq capabilities at runtime.</p>

<h1 id="community-infrastructure">Community Infrastructure</h1>

<p>Our efforts in community building have seen the unification of single-cell subdomains into <a href="https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/">https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu/</a>, the creation of the Single Cell Community of Practice hub page (<a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/">https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/</a>), and a user-focused Matrix channel. Testing brilliant widgets, automated updates, and the latest addition of automated help request updates onto Matrix channels have made community collaboration a breeze.</p>

<h1 id="global-connections">Global Connections</h1>

<p>Down under, the Australian BioCommons launched their <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10368976">Single Cell and Spatial Omics Analysis Infrastructure Roadmap for Australia</a>, complementing our endeavors to unite across timezones. Collaboration, including international tool adventures across three continents, proves that team work does, in fact, make the dream work.</p>

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>Get ready for a thrilling journey through the <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell">Single Cell Training</a>‚Äôs latest updates! The <strong>Case Study Reloaded</strong> tutorial, fueled by three remote-working undergrads, introduces parallel trajectory analysis in R, Python, and the Galaxy GUI.</p>

<p>Sustainability shines as we‚Äôve revamped numerous tutorials with hands-on and video re-recordings. New tools bring new tutorials, such as <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scatac-preprocessing-tenx/tutorial.html">Pre-processing of 10X Single-Cell ATAC-seq Datasets</a> and <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/bulk-music-4-compare/tutorial.html">Comparing inferred cell compositions using MuSiC deconvolution</a>.</p>

<p>Tackling user hurdles, our data ingest and conversion tutorials in the <strong>Changing data formats &amp; preparing objects</strong> section await exploration.</p>

<p>Dive into the unique <strong>Tips, tricks &amp; other hints</strong> section, offering analysis options like <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scanpy_parameter_iterator/tutorial.html">parameter iteration</a> for swift optimization or <a href="/training-material/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_cell-cycle/tutorial.html">Removing the effects of the cell cycle</a> for precise clustering analysis.</p>

<h1 id="fighting-work-duplication">Fighting Work Duplication</h1>

<p>Our mission: No more work duplication! We‚Äôve consolidated single-cell instances and are diligently preventing tool and infrastructure duplication, creating smoother pathways across servers. We value efficiency here at single-cell, so we‚Äôd like to thank ChatGPT (free version) for adding in Galaxy puns to this post, as per our request.</p>

One of the compounds my group was working on was piperine, extracted from black pepper. Inspired by literature findings, we found out that the derivatives of piperine can inhibit monoamine oxidase-B and thus can be possibly used in Parkinson‚Äôs disease. As a novelty element in our project, we came up with new structures of derivatives that could act as inhibitors.</p>

<p>Before synthesising any new molecules, it would make sense to check if they correctly dock into the active site. As an enthusiastic user and developer of Galaxy, the idea of using GTN came straight to my mind. Even though molecular docking was beyond the scope of our project, I knew that Galaxy and GTN give such an amazing opportunity to do it in the blink of an eye that I wouldn‚Äôt be myself if I hadn‚Äôt tried! Therefore, by using the <a href="/training-material/topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/cheminformatics/tutorial.html">tutorial on molecular docking</a>, I identified the pocket, then I studied the binding of the approved drugs such as Safinamide and Zonisamide and finally I checked how our proposed molecule fits within the pocket. After that, we were ready to synthesise the derivative we came up with!</p>

<p>This example shows how GTN and Galaxy can facilitate and accelerate the work of medicinal chemists before starting the synthesis. It is easy to follow the GTN tutorials, the results are reproducible, the datasets are stored in the history and can be easily shared with anyone on the team.</p>]]></content><author><name>Julia Jakiela</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="computational chemistry" /><category term="user story" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a medicinal chemistry student, I undertook a semester project on natural products isolation and derivatisation.
