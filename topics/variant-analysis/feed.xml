    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pox viruses (&lt;em&gt;Poxviridae&lt;/em&gt;) are a large family of viruses, and members of it have various vertebrate and arthropod species as their natural hosts. The most widely known species in the family are the now extinct variola virus from the genus &lt;em&gt;orthopoxvirus&lt;/em&gt; as the cause of smallpox, and vaccinia virus, a related, likely horsepox virus, which served as the source for the smallpox vaccine that allowed eradication of that disease.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To discover causal mutations of inherited diseases it’s common practice to do a trio analysis. In a trio analysis DNA is sequenced of both the patient and parents. Using this method, it’s possible to identify multiple inheritance patterns. Some examples of these patterns are autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and  de-novo variants, which are represented in the figure below. To elaborate, the most left tree shows an autosomal dominant inhertitance pattern where the offspring inherits a faulty copy of the gene from one of the parents. The center subfigure represents an autosomal recessive disease, here the offspring inherited a faulty copy of the same gene from both parents. In the right subfigure a de-novo mutation is shown, which is caused by a mutation during the offspring’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a bug present in TB Variant Report (aka tbvcfreport) version 0.1.8 and earlier. In this case it is triggered by the presence of variants in Rv3798. You only see this bug, however, if you forget to run &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;tb_variant_filter&lt;/code&gt; (TB Variant Filter). Rv3798 is a suspected transposase and any variants in this gene region would be filtered out by &lt;code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"&gt;tb_variant_filter&lt;/code&gt;, so if you see this crash, make sure you have run the filter step before the TB Variant Report step.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The majority of life on Earth is non-diploid and represented by prokaryotes, viruses, and their derivatives, such as our own mitochondria or plant’s chloroplasts. In non-diploid systems, allele frequencies can range anywhere between 0 and 100% and there could be multiple (not just two) alleles per locus. The main challenge associated with non-diploid variant calling is the difficulty in distinguishing between the sequencing noise (abundant in all NGS platforms) and true low frequency variants. Some of the early attempts to do this well have been accomplished on human mitochondrial DNA although the same approaches will work equally good on viral and bacterial genomes (&lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="#Rebolledo-Jaramillo2014"&gt;Rebolledo-Jaramillo &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="#Li2015"&gt;Li &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
