<h2 id="1-friends-dont-let-friends-make-bar-plots-for-means-separation">1. Friends Don’t Let Friends Make Bar Plots for Means Separation</h2>

<p><img src="images/dont_bar_plot.png" alt="No Bar Plots for Means Separation" /></p>

<p>.footnote[inspired by many tweets the author saw on limitations of the bar graph. See e.g. <span class="citation"><a href="#Weissgerber_2015">Weissgerber <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>This has to be the first one.</li>
  <li>Means separation plots are some of the most common in scientific publications.</li>
  <li>We have two or more groups, which contains multiple observations; they may have different means, variances, and distributions.</li>
  <li>The task of the visualization is to show the means and the spread (dispersion) of the data.</li>
  <li>In this example, two groups have similar means and standard deviations, but quite different distributions.</li>
  <li>Are they really “the same”?</li>
  <li>Just don’t use bar plot for means separation, or at least check a couple things before settling down on a bar plot.</li>
  <li>It’s worth mentioning that I was inspired by many researchers who have tweeted on the limitation of bar graphs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-friends-dont-let-friends-make-violin-plots-for-small-sample-sizes">2. Friends Don’t Let Friends Make Violin Plots for Small Sample Sizes</h2>

<p><img src="images/Beware_of_small_n_box_violin_plot.png" alt="Beware of Violin Plots for Small Sample Sizes" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is quite common in the literature as well, but unfortunately, violin plots (or any sort of smoothed distribution curves) make no sense for small n.</li>
  <li>Distributions and quartiles can vary widely with small n, even if the underlying observations are similar.</li>
  <li>Distribution and quartiles are only meaningful with large n.</li>
  <li>I did an experiment before, where I sampled the same normal distribution several times and computed the quartiles for each sample.</li>
  <li>The quartiles only stablize when n gets larger than 50.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-friends-dont-let-friends-use-bidirectional-color-scales-for-unidirectional-data">3. Friends Don’t Let Friends Use Bidirectional Color Scales for Unidirectional Data</h2>

<p><img src="images/ColorScales.png" alt="Are You Using the Right Color Scale for Your Data?" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Excuse my language, but this is a truly data visualization sin, and again quite common.</li>
  <li>I can understand why this error is common, because it appears that many of us have not spent a lot of thoughts on this issue.</li>
  <li>Color scales are pretty, but we have to be extra careful.</li>
  <li>When color scales (or color gradients) are used to represent numerical data, the darkest and lightest colors should have special meanings.</li>
  <li>You can decide what those special meanings are: e.g., max, min, mean, zero. But they should represent something meaningful.</li>
  <li>A data visualization sin for heat maps/color gradients is when the lightest or darkers colors are some arbitrary numbers.</li>
  <li>This is as bad as the longest bar in a bar chart not being the largest value. Can you imagine that?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-friends-dont-let-friends-make-bar-plot-meadow">4. Friends Don’t Let Friends Make Bar Plot Meadow</h2>

<p><img src="images/AvoidBarPlotMeadow.png" alt="Horrendous Giant Bar Plot vs. Better Designed Plot" /></p>

<p>.footnote[Data from <span class="citation"><a href="#Matand_2020">Matand <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span>]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>We talked about no bar charts for mean separation, but this is a different issue.</li>
  <li>It has to do with presenting results of a multi-factorial experiment.</li>
  <li>Bar plot meadows are very common in scientific publications and unfortunately also ineffective in communicating the results.</li>
  <li>Bar plot meadows are common because multi-factorial experiments are common.</li>
  <li>However, a bar plot meadow is poorly designed for its purpose.</li>
  <li>To communicate results of a multi-factorial experiment, it requires thoughtful designs regarding grouping/faceting by factors of interest.</li>
  <li>In this example, I focus on comparing the effect of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Treatment</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Explant</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Response</code> at the level of each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Variety</code>.</li>
  <li>However, if the focus is the effect of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Treatment</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Variety</code> on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Response</code> at the level of each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Exaplant</code>, then it will require a different layout.</li>

<p><img src="images/Reorder_rows_and_columns_for_heatmap.png" alt="A Heatmap before and after reordering rows and columns" /></p>

<p>.footnote[Data from <span class="citation"><a href="#Li_2022">Li <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Heatmaps are very common in scientific publications, and very very common in omics papers.</li>
  <li>However, for heatmaps to be effective, we have to consider the ordering of rows and columns.</li>
  <li>In this example, I have cells as columns and features as rows. Grids are showing z scores.</li>
  <li>It is impossible to get anything useful out of the heatmap without reordering rows and columns.</li>
  <li>We can reorder rows and columns using clustering, but that is not the only way.</li>
  <li>Of course, if the rows and columns are mapping to physical entities (rows and columns of a 96-well plate), then you can’t reorder them.</li>
  <li>But it is a very good idea to at least consider reordering rows and columns.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/Check_outliers_for_heatmap.png" alt="Did you check outliers" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Outliers in heatmap can really change how we perceive and interpret the visualization.</li>
  <li>This generalizes to all sort of visualizations that use colors to represent numeric data.</li>
  <li>Let me show you an example:</li>
  <li>In this example, I have 2 observations. For each observations, I measured 20 features.</li>
  <li>Without checking for outliers, it may appear that the 2 observations are overall similar, except at 2 features.</li>
  <li>However, after maxing out the color scale around 95th percentile of the data, it reveals that the two observations are distinct across all features.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-friends-dont-let-friends-forget-to-check-data-range-at-each-factor-level">7. Friends Don’t Let Friends Forget to Check Data Range at Each Factor Level</h2>

<p><img src="images/Check_range_at_factor_level.png" alt="Did you check data range at each factor level" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is a common issue that many of us have encountered.</li>
  <li>In a multifactor experiment, sometimes the range of the response variable changes widely between different factor levels.</li>
  <li>This hypothetical experiment measured 3 compounds across 2 groups (control vs. treatment).</li>
  <li>Without checking data range for each compound, you will likely have missed that the treatment had a strong effect on compound 1.</li>
  <li>This is because the concentration of compound 1 has a much narrower range than the other compounds in this experiment.</li>

<p>.footnote[Data from <span class="citation"><a href="#Li_2022">Li <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Network graphs are common in scientific publications. They are super useful in presenting relationship data.</li>
  <li>However, the apparence (not the topology) of the network can make a huge difference in determing if a network graph is effective.</li>
  <li>Layouts can drastically change the appearance of networks, making them easier or harder to interpret.</li>
  <li>Here are 3 network graphs from the same data. They look very different from each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="9-friends-dont-let-friends-confuse-position-based-visualizations-with-length-based-visualizations">9. Friends Don’t Let Friends Confuse Position-based Visualizations with Length-based Visualizations</h2>

<p><img src="images/Position_and_length_based_visualizations.png" alt="Position vs. length based visualizations" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is always the elephant in the room and the essence of many misleading visualizations.</li>
  <li>In this example, I measured a response variable across 3 time points.</li>
  <li>Two of the following graphs are fine, but one of them is a data visualization crime. Can you see why?</li>
  <li>In dot and line plots, values are represented by positions along the x and y axis.</li>
  <li>The same idea applies to other position based visualizations, such as box plots.</li>
  <li>In bar plots, values are represented by the distance from the x axis, and thus the length of the bar.</li>
  <li>The 3rd graph is not 0-based, which makes the bar length at time point 2 about 3x longer than that at time point 1.</li>
  <li>In fact, the true difference in means is closer to 1.6x.</li>
  <li>I hope you can see how confusing length and position based visualizations can lead to misleading graphs.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-bar-plots-with-broken-axis">Watch out for bar plots with broken axis</h3>

<p><img src="images/Broken_axis.png" alt="Broken axis" /></p>

<p>.footnote[<a href="https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends/blob/main/Scripts/Broken_axis.R">Example R Code</a>]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Broken axis may be useful for depicting data across a wide range of numeric values.</li>
  <li>(Alternatively, log scaled axis can be used instead.)</li>
  <li>Broken axis are fine for position based graphics, because the data are represented by positions along the axis.</li>
  <li>However, we must be very careful with bar plots that have broken axis. Here is an example.</li>
  <li>In this example, two graphs (left vs. right) are showing the same data.</li>
  <li>However, by changing where the axis is broken, one can make certain bars looks longer or shorter.</li>
  <li>In this example, the length of bar “d” can look really different.</li>
  <li>The illusion of bar “d” being very short on the right graph boils down to bar plot being a length based graphics, not a position based graphics.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="10-friends-dont-let-friends-make-pie-chart">10. Friends Don’t Let Friends Make Pie Chart</h2>

<p><img src="images/dont_pie_chart.png" alt="Don't make pie charts" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pie chart is a common type of visualization for fractional data, where fractions add up to 100%.</li>
  <li>This is achieved by dividing a circle into sectors, and the sectors add up to a full circle.</li>
  <li>Pie charts have been criticized, because human are much worse in reading angles and area than reading lengths.</li>
  <li>In this example, we have two groups, each contains 4 sub-categories.</li>
  <li>In classic pie charts, the angles (and thus arc lengths &amp; sector area) represent the data.</li>
  <li>The problem is that it is very difficult to compare between groups.</li>
  <li>We can visually simplify the pie chart into donut charts, where the data are now represented by arc lengths.</li>
  <li>However, if we want to use lengths to represent the data, why don’t we just unwrap the donut and make stacked bars?</li>
  <li>In stacked bar graphs, bars are shown side-by-side and thus easier to compare across groups.</li>
  <li>Fun fact: the scripts underlying stacked bars are much simpler than those underlying the pie charts and donut charts.</li>
  <li>If you want to produce sub-optimal graph types with ggplot, you actually have to work extra hard.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="11-friends-dont-let-friends-make-concentric-donuts">11. Friends Don’t Let Friends Make Concentric Donuts</h2>

<p><img src="images/dont_concentric_donuts.png" alt="Don't make concentric donuts" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>In this example, we have 3 groups, each of which contains two sub-categories (Type I or Type II).</li>
  <li>In concentric donuts, you might be tempted to say the data are represented by the arc lengths, which is in fact inaccurate.</li>
  <li>The arc lengths on the outer rings are much longer than those in the inner rings.</li>
  <li>Group 2 and Group 3 have the same exact values, but the arc lengths of Group 3 are much longer.</li>
  <li>In fact the data are represented by the arc angles, which we are bad at reading.</li>
  <li>Since outer rings are longer, the ordering of the groups (which group goes to which ring) has a big impact on the impression of the plot.</li>
  <li>It can lead to the apparent paradox where larger values have shorter arcs.</li>
  <li>The better (and simpler!) alternative is just unwrap the donuts and make a good old stacked bar plot.</li>
  <li>BTW, this is also my main issue with circos plots and other circular plot layouts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="12-friends-dont-let-friends-use-redgreen-and-rainbow-color-scales">12. Friends Don’t Let Friends Use Red/Green and Rainbow color scales</h2>

<p><img src="images/Color_blind_grey_scale_safe_heatmap.png" alt="are you making a &quot;safe&quot; heatmap?" /></p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Deuteranomaly is the most common type of red/green colorblindness, occurring in 1/16 male and 1/256 female.</li>
  <li>Any color scales that use shades of red and shades of green in the same time would be a problem for a person with red/green colorblindness (third column of the figure).</li>
  <li>In addition, red/green and rainbow do not preserve information well at all when printed on black/white (grey scale, second column in figure).</li>
  <li>Many scientific software still use red/green or rainbow as the default color scales, which drives me crazy.</li>
  <li>More “modern” color scales, such as viridis are both colorblind-friendly and grey scale-safe (third row of figure).</li>
  <li>And they look nice too.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="13-friends-dont-let-friends-forget-to-reorder-stacked-bar-plot">13. Friends Don’t Let Friends Forget to Reorder Stacked Bar Plot</h2>

<p><img src="images/Reorder_stacked_bars.png" alt="Reorder your stacked bars" /></p>

<p>.footnote[<a href="https://github.com/cxli233/FriendsDontLetFriends/blob/main/Scripts/stacked_bars_optimization.Rmd">Tutorial on optimising</a>.]</p>

<p><span>Speaker Notes</span></p>

<ul>
  <li>Stacked bar plots are useful for visualizing proportion data.</li>
  <li>Stacked bar plots are commonly used to visualize community structure or population structure or admixture analysis.</li>
  <li>This kind of visualization boils down to a collection of samples, where each sample contains multiple classes of members.</li>
  <li>However, when we have many samples and many classes, stacked bar plots need to be optimized to be effective.</li>
  <li>And by “optimize” I mean the grouping and ordering of samples.</li>
  <li>Here we have an example data with 100 samples and 8 classes of member.</li>
  <li>Due to the number of samples and classes, it is very hard to discern anything from this graph without optimizing the order of bars. What the heck am I looking at?</li>
  <li>After reordering the bars, wow, that really made a difference, don’t you think?</li>
</ul>
