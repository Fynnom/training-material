    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The study of metabolites in biological samples is routinely defined as metabolomics. Metabolomics’ studies based on untargeted mass spectrometry provide the capability to investigate metabolism on a global and relatively unbiased scale in comparison to traditional targeted studies focused on specific pathways of metabolism and a small number of metabolites. The untargeted approach enables the detection of thousands of metabolites in hypothesis-generating studies and links previously unknown metabolites with biologically important roles &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="#Patti2012"&gt;Patti &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt; 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. There are two major issues in contemporary mass spectrometry-based metabolomics: the first is enormous loads of signal generated during the experiments, and the second is the fact that some metabolites in the studied samples may not be known to us. These obstacles make the task of processing and interpreting the metabolomics data a cumbersome and time-consuming process &lt;span class="citation"&gt;&lt;a href="#Nash2019"&gt;Nash and Dunn 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is applied to measure the spatial distribution of hundreds of biomolecules in a sample. A mass spectrometer scans over the entire sample and collects a mass spectrum every 5-200 µm. This results in thousands of spots (or pixels) for each of which a mass spectrum is acquired. Each mass spectrum consists of hundreds of analytes that are measured by their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio. For each analyte the peak intensity in the mass spectra of every pixel is known and can be set together to map the spatial distribution of the analyte in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
