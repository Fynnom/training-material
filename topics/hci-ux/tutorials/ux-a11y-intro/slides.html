# What is UX? (User Experience Design)

Having good user experience means making your user interface as easy and straight-forward to use by as many people as possible.

# What is Accessibility? (Sometimes called a11y)

Having good accessibility means making your user interface as easy and straight-forward to use by as many people as possible.

TODO: can we narrate with the transitions nicely?

# UX and Accessibility go Hand in Hand

- Benefit ease of use
- Allows for more methods of interacting with UI
- Makes the UI easier to understand
- Makes UIs usable on more devices

**Accessibility is for everyone**

---

# Semantic HTML

- Give meaning to containers
- Can be used by software such as screen readers
- May come with useful default behaviour
- Document the markup

---

# Headings

.pull-right[

## Example Structure


* h1 (page title)
  * h2
  * h2
    * h3
      * h4
      * h4
    * h3
  * h2
    * h3
    * h3
      * h4
        * h5
        * h5
        * h5
  * h2
]

.pull-left[

- Come in several Level(h1, h2, h3, …)
- Levels do  __not__  indicate size
- Levels give your page structure.This structure can be extracted by screen-readers and other software,to better navigate the site
- __Detach size styling from the heading level__

Also see `<hgroup>` which can group sub-headings, or alternative headings with a heading

# Keyboard Navigation

Attempt navigating your components with keyboard

.pull-left[
“X” buttons can offer too many click targets, which need to be cycled through, when many tags are present.

.pull-right[

Re-entering tag removes it instead.

# Color and Contrast

- Contrast mostly determined by perceived lightness
- HSL does  __not __ model perceived lightness


.pull-left[
Constant HSL lightness with varying hue. Notice the contrast to the text.

# Accessible Fonts

* Easy to differentiate between similar looking letters
* Readable with:
  * Small font-size
  * Small screen
  * Blurry vision
  * Low resolution
* Spacing narrow enough to connect words, far enough to differentiate letters.
* Consistent shapes
  * lower-case vs UPPER-CASE
  * Letters vs Numbers 0123 vs Symbols ,!?=”
