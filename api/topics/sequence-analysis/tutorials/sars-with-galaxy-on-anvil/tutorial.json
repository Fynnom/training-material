For example 10 corresponds to “+” and 40 corresponds to “I”. FastQC knows how to translate this. This is often called “Phred” scoring.</p>   <p><img src=\"/training-material/topics/sequence-analysis/faqs/images/fastq-quality-encoding.png\" alt=\"Encoding of the quality score with ASCII characters for different Phred encoding. The ascii code sequence is shown at the top with symbols for 33 to 64, upper case letters, more symbols, and then lowercase letters.

Type in the reference position “24410” and click “Go”. You should see a bunch of “A”s highlighted in green throughout our sample. The reference sequence (top line) is a “G” but all of the reads are an “A”. This means that our sample is genetically different from the established SARS-CoV-2 reference genome!

Sometimes this happens when the samples are being prepared in the lab and sometimes this happens because the sequencer makes a mistake. This is one reason why quality scores are helpful. With millions of reads of data, it’s more likely that we see a “SNP” that is actually an accident. Multiple copies of the same areas of our data (“read depth”) help us be sure it’s a real SNP. When we compare across lots of aligned reads of the same area, we can determine the actual sequence by consensus. For example, we can be reasonably confident that the “G” at position 1,203 is just a sequencing or lab mistake.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"export-your-history\">Export Your History</h1>\n\n<p>It’s a good idea to export your “History” so that your collaborators can see what you did.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Export History to Workspace</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Click on the History Menu <i class=\"fas fa-bars\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">galaxy-history-options</span> and click on “Export History to File”.\n  <a href=\"../../images/sars-with-galaxy-in-anvil/16-export-history.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/sars-with-galaxy-in-anvil/16-export-history.png\" alt=\"History dropdown menu button and Export History to File buttons are highlighted.\" width=\"2456\" height=\"1622\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></li>\n    <li>Make sure you select “to a remote file”.
