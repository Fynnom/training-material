For humans, the genome is all of a person’s chromosomes.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Chromosome</strong></p>\n\n      <p>The largest unit of DNA organization in an organism.  Humans have two copies of 23 chromosomes.  Chromosomes are <em>linear</em> in humans, and all animals and plants.  (Bacteria have <em>circular</em> chromosomes.)</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Strand</strong></p>\n\n      <p>Chromosomes are <em>double-stranded</em>.  One is the forward strand, is typically drawn on top, and moves from left to right. The other, reverse strand, is typically drawn on the bottom and moves from right to left.  Genes can occur on either strand.  A single gene will have parts on only one stand.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Gene</strong></p>\n\n      <p>“What is a gene?” is actually a hotly debated question.  For our purposes, a gene is a section of DNA on chromosome strand that creates a molecule used by an organism.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>Graphically, the human genome can be shown as the chromosomes that are in it:</p>\n\n  <p><a href=\"../../images/human_genome_chroms.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/human_genome_chroms.png\" alt=\"Human genome consists of 23 (pairs of) chromosomes. \" width=\"794\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n  <p>And here’s a representation of a chromosome, strands, and genes on the chromosome.</p>\n\n  <p><a href=\"../../images/chromosome_strands_genes.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/chromosome_strands_genes.png\" alt=\"Chromosomes are double stranded and have forward and reverse strands; strands have genes on them. \" width=\"794\" height=\"487\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question we are asking looks like:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/do_genes_on_opposite_strands_ever_overlap.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/do_genes_on_opposite_strands_ever_overlap.png\" alt=\"Does a situation like this exist?\" width=\"794\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><em>Non-overlapping genes are common.  How common are overlapping genes?</em></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"get-human-data\">Get human data</h1>\n\n<p>To answer this question we need to know where genes start and stop on human chromosomes.  That seems like a simple question, but if you are new to bioinformatics it’s actually a hard question to answer.  Web searches will land you at any number of useful places on the web, but without a lot of background knowledge it’s hard to know what you want:  <em>What’s the difference between sequence and annotation?  What are FASTA, BED, GTF, GFF3, and VCF?  What are GRCh37, GRCh38, hg19, and hg38 (and what happened to hg20 through hg37 - are they okay)?</em></p>\n\n<p>It turns out that for this particular question (and for many others), most <strong>Galaxy</strong> instances can help us find this information.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Log in to Galaxy</hands-on-title>\n  <p>In your web browser, <em>go to</em> <strong>your Galaxy instance</strong> and <em>log in or register</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Galaxy interface consists of three main parts.

If you are working on a species that UCSC supports (like human) then the Table Browser is a great place to get genomic data.</p>\n\n<p>The Table Browser has a daunting number of options. Fortunately, they are all set to commonly used defaults, greatly simplifying things, and most of the options are already set to what we want:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>clade:</strong> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Mammal</code></li>\n  <li><strong>genome:</strong> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Human</code></li>\n  <li><strong>assembly:</strong> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38)</code></li>\n  <li><strong>group:</strong> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Genes and Gene Predictions</code></li>\n  <li><strong>track:</strong> <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GENCODE v41</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>clade</strong> and <strong>genome</strong> seem pretty clear.  <strong>assembly</strong> asks which version/definition of the human genome we want.  (Any will do for our question, but UCSC is suggesting <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hg38</code>, which is also the most recent.)  <strong>group</strong> is set to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Genes and Gene Predictions</code> which sounds like what we want. So far so good.</p>\n\n<p><strong>track</strong> has a bewildering list of options. UCSC suggests <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GENCODE v41</code>.  A web search leads us to the <a href=\"https://www.gencodegenes.org/\">GENCODE web site</a> which prominently states:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"warning\">\n  <warning-title>ALL GENCODE is different from GENCODE</warning-title>\n  <p><strong>Warning</strong> The Table browser only provides the most recent release of GENCODE which is updated several times per year. ALL GENCODE does not contain the same data as GENCODE and you should select the GENCODE track even if the version number is wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"quote\">\n  <p>The goal of the GENCODE project is to identify and classify all gene features in the human and mouse genomes with high accuracy based on biological evidence…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Time for a few more definitions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>Definitions 2</comment-title>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Reference genome</strong></p>\n\n      <p>A reference genome is the <em>genome of a single individual</em> that has been thoroughly studied, to the point that we know exactly what most of that individual’s DNA is.  In practice a reference genome is used as shared map by researchers working on that organism. Reference genomes are updated periodically as techniques improve.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Sequence</strong></p>\n\n      <p>A genome’s sequence describes the DNA in that genome, down to the A, C, T, and G (single nucleotide) level including the exact location where each is.  Given a reference genome, you can ask questions like, “What’s the DNA on chromosome 2 between positions 1,678,901 and 1.688,322?”</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p><strong>Genome/Gene annotation</strong></p>\n\n      <p>The sequence tells us what DNA is where, but it doesn’t tell us anything about the function of that DNA.  <em>Annotation</em> is additional information about particular regions of the genome like where genes, repeats, promotors, and centromeres are, or how active a particular gene is.</p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <strong>track</strong> option asks us which set of annotations do we want to get?  There are so many choices because annotation is the result of analysis and interpretation, and there are many ways to do this. (And in this case, many of the options aren’t even genes or gene predictions.)</p>\n\n<p>GENCODE is “high-quality” and  “gene annotation.” That sounds like a good thing to use.  Lets stay with the default: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GENCODE V41</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So far we haven’t changed <em>anything</em> from the defaults.  Lets change something.  The default  <strong>region</strong> is the whole genome, which can be done, but it’s a lot of information.

Our example BED file describes genes and contains 12 columns.</p>\n\n  <p>We care about columns 1, 2, 3, and 6:</p>\n\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th>#</th>\n        <th>Column Name</th>\n        <th>Meaning</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>Chromosome</td>\n        <td>The name of the chromosome this gene is on.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>Start</td>\n        <td>Where on the chromosome the gene starts.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td>End</td>\n        <td>Where on the chromosome the gene ends.</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>6</td>\n        <td>Strand</td>\n        <td>Which strand the gene is on.  <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">+</code> means forward (top, left to right), <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-</code> means reverse (bottom, right to left)</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n\n  <p>See the <a href=\"https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1\">BED format description at UCSC</a> for a full description of all the columns.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"naming\">Naming</h2>\n\n<p>Galaxy allows you to name your analyses (your histories) and your datasets.

Probably.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s refine our question slightly</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title>Our Revised Motivating Question</question-title>\n  <p><em>I wonder if <strong>exons</strong> on opposite strands ever overlap with each other, and if so, how common is that?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"so-i-have-to-do-this-all-over-again-but-with-exons\">So, I have to do this all over again, but with exons?</h3>\n\n<p><em>Well, yes and no.</em>  We will have to run the analysis again, this time on exons instead of whole genes. But we won’t have to manually recreate every step of our analysis. Galaxy enables us to create a reusable <em>workflow</em> from the analysis we just did, and then we can rerun the analysis, as one step, anytime we want to, and on any dataset.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"walk-through-the-workflow-tutorial\">Walk through the workflow tutorial</h2>\n\n<p>Run the <a href=\"/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/history-to-workflow/tutorial.html\">Create a reusable workflow from a history</a> tutorial for how to do this, <em>and then come back here to run your newly created workflow with the exon data.</em></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"rerun-analysis-with-exon-data\">Rerun analysis with exon data</h1>\n\n<p>We want to run the same analysis, but this time only look for overlaps that happen in <em>exons</em>, the parts of genes that produce stuff our body uses.  Before we start looking at exons, let’s start a new history, one that contains only the genes file we got from UCSC. We could go back to UCSC and refetch the file, but there is an easier way.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Create a new history that contains some data from current history</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li><em>Click</em> on the <strong>gear icon</strong> at the top of the current history.</li>\n    <li><em>Select</em> the <strong>Copy Datasets</strong> option from the pull down menu.  This launches the copy datasets form.</li>\n    <li>Under <strong>Source History:</strong>, <em>select</em> the dataset(s) you want to copy to the new history.\n      <ul>\n        <li>In our case, we only want the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Genes chr22</code> dataset.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Under <strong>Destination History</strong> enter an informative history name in the <strong>New history named:</strong> box.\n      <ul>\n        <li>For example, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Exon overlaps on opposite strands</code>\n<a href=\"../../images/copy_datasets_to_new_history.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/copy_datasets_to_new_history.png\" alt=\"Copy only the Genes chr22  dataset to the new history. \" width=\"962\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><em>Click</em> the <strong>Copy History Items</strong> button to create your new history.\n      <ul>\n        <li>This creates a new history (with the copied dataset) and throws up a green box saying:\n“1 dataset copied to 1 history: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">name you gave your new history</code>.”</li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>The history name is a link.  <em>Click</em> on it.</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-the-exon-data\">Get the exon data</h2>\n\n<p>And your new history appears in the history panel with the copied <em>genes</em> dataset.  What we need is <em>exons.</em> How can we get the exon information?  There are two relatively easy ways to get this information, one of which will be very familiar.</p>\n\n<p>The first method involves going back to the UCSC Table Browser.  Everything on the first form would stay the same: We still want human, hg38, GENCODE v41, and just <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">chr22</code>. The second form is what changes.  Instead of getting the <strong>Whole Gene</strong>, we need to retrieve the <strong>Coding Exons</strong> only.</p>\n\n<p>The second method is to use the <strong>Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander</strong> tool in the <strong>Operate on Genomic Intervals</strong> toolbox to extract the exon information from the genes BED file we already have. (<em>Of course!</em> you say.  Umm, there is no way that you should have known that you already had this information in the genes file, or that this tool existed.)</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Get the exon data</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Get the exon information, either by revisiting UCSC, or by using the <span class=\"tool\" data-tool=\"gene2exon1\" title=\"Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander tool\" aria-role=\"button\"><i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED expander</strong></span> tool.

You can refresh the history panel by either reloading the whole page, of by clicking the looping arrow icon at the top of the history panel.  What you’ll see is a stack of history steps that will go from queued to running to done as you watch them.</p>\n\n<p>All steps in the history will be green when the workflow is done. Once that happens compare your output dataset with your input dataset?  What percentage of exons overlap with other exons on the opposite strand, and is it common or rare?  Is it a smaller percentage than we saw for whole genes?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"are-we-done\">Are we done?</h2>\n\n<p>Probably.  Note that we can no longer say what percentage of <em>genes</em> overlap.  We <em>can</em> say what percentage of exons overlap, and that is probably close enough for our goals.  If it isn’t and we actually need to say what percentage of genes overlap, then we will have to do some extra work.  This can be done is several ways, but the Galaxy 101 tutorial may give you some ideas on how to follow this question all the way to genes.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p><i class=\"fas fa-trophy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">trophy</span> Well done! You have just performed your first analysis in Galaxy!</p>\n\n<!--SNIPPET-->\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">   <div class=\"box-title tip-title\" id=\"tip-why-not-use-excel\"><button class=\"gtn-boxify-button tip\" type=\"button\" aria-controls=\"tip-why-not-use-excel\" aria-expanded=\"true\"><i class=\"far fa-lightbulb\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <span>Tip: Why not use Excel?</span><span class=\"fold-unfold fa fa-minus-square\"></span></button></div>   <p>You could just as easily use Excel to answer the same question, and if the goal is to learn how to use a tool, then either tool would be great! But what if you are working on a question where your analysis matters? Maybe you are working with human clinical data trying to diagnose a set of symptoms, or you are working on research that will eventually be published and maybe earn you a Nobel Prize?</p>   <p>In these cases your analysis, <em>and the ability to reproduce it exactly</em>, is vitally important, and Excel won’t help you here. It doesn’t track changes and it offers very little insight to others on how you got from your initial data to your conclusions.</p>   <p>Galaxy, on the other hand, <em>automatically records every step of your analysis.</em> And when you are done, you can share your analysis with anyone. You can even include a link to it in a paper (or your acceptance speech). In addition, you can create a reusable workflow from your analysis that others (or yourself) can use on other datasets.</p>   <p>Another challenge with spreadsheet programs is that they don’t scale to support <em>next generation sequencing (NGS)</em> datasets, a common type of data in genomics, and which often reach gigabytes or even terabytes in size. Excel has been used for large datasets, but you’ll often find that learning a new tool gives you significantly more ability to scale up, and scale out your analyses.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><!--END_SNIPPET--></p>\n"],"ref_slides":[],"hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-05-29 15:37:52 +0000","pub_date":"2017-10-18 16:00:54 +0000","version":78,"workflows":[{"workflow":"Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands-2.ga","tests":false,"url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-strands/workflows/Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands-2.ga","path":"topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-strands/workflows/Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands-2.ga","wfid":"introduction-galaxy-intro-strands","wfname":"galaxy-workflowlaxy-intro-strands-2","trs_endpoint":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools/introduction-galaxy-intro-strands/versions/galaxy-workflowlaxy-intro-strands-2","license":null,"creators":[],"name":"Galaxy Intro Strands 2","title":"Galaxy Intro Strands 2","test_results":null,"modified":"2024-06-24 07:44:29 +0000","mermaid":"flowchart TD\n  0[\"ℹ️ Input Dataset\\nInput dataset\"];\n  style 0 stroke:#2c3143,stroke-width:4px;\n  1[\"Gene BED To Exon/Intron/Codon BED\"];\n  0 -->|output| 1;\n  2[\"Filter\"];\n  1 -->|out_file1| 2;\n  3[\"Filter\"];\n  1 -->|out_file1| 3;\n  4[\"Intersect\"];\n  2 -->|out_file1| 4;\n  3 -->|out_file1| 4;\n  5[\"Intersect\"];\n  3 -->|out_file1| 5;\n  2 -->|out_file1| 5;\n  6[\"Concatenate datasets\"];\n  5 -->|output| 6;\n  4 -->|output| 6;"},{"workflow":"Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands.ga","tests":false,"url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-strands/workflows/Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands.ga","path":"topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-strands/workflows/Galaxy-Workflow-galaxy-intro-strands.ga","wfid":"introduction-galaxy-intro-strands","wfname":"galaxy-workflowlaxy-intro-strands","trs_endpoint":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/ga4gh/trs/v2/tools/introduction-galaxy-intro-strands/versions/galaxy-workflowlaxy-intro-strands","license":null,"creators":[],"name":"Galaxy Intro Strands","title":"Galaxy Intro Strands","test_results":null,"modified":"2024-06-24 07:44:29 +0000","mermaid":"flowchart TD\n  0[\"ℹ️ Input Dataset\\nInput dataset\"];\n  style 0 stroke:#2c3143,stroke-width:4px;\n  1[\"Filter\"];\n  0 -->|output| 1;\n  2[\"Filter\"];\n  0 -->|output| 2;\n  3[\"Filter\"];\n  0 -->|output| 3;\n  4[\"Intersect\"];\n  2 -->|out_file1| 4;\n  3 -->|out_file1| 4;\n  5[\"Intersect\"];\n  3 -->|out_file1| 5;\n  2 -->|out_file1| 5;\n  6[\"Concatenate datasets\"];\n  5 -->|output| 6;\n  4 -->|output| 6;"}],"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-strands/tutorial.json","tools":["Filter1","cat1","gene2exon1","toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_cat/0.1.0","toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/intersect/gops_intersect_1/1.0.0"],"supported_servers":{"exact":[{"url":"https://usegalaxy.cz/","name":"UseGalaxy.cz","usegalaxy":false},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","name":"UseGalaxy.eu","usegalaxy":true},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.fr/","name":"UseGalaxy.fr","usegalaxy":false},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.no/","name":"UseGalaxy.no","usegalaxy":false},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.org","name":"UseGalaxy.org (Main)","usegalaxy":true},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","usegalaxy":true}],"inexact":[{"url":"https://mississippi.sorbonne-universite.fr","name":"MISSISSIPPI","usegalaxy":false}]},"topic_name_human":"Introduction to Galaxy Analyses","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[{"name":"text_processing","owner":"bgruening","revisions":"ddf54b12c295","tool_panel_section_label":"Text Manipulation","tool_shed_url":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"},{"name":"intersect","owner":"devteam","revisions":"69c10b56f46d","tool_panel_section_label":"Text Manipulation","tool_shed_url":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"}]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools:\n- name: text_processing\n  owner: bgruening\n  revisions: ddf54b12c295\n  tool_panel_section_label: Text Manipulation\n  tool_shed_url: https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/\n- name: intersect\n  owner: devteam\n  revisions: 69c10b56f46d\n  tool_panel_section_label: Text Manipulation\n  tool_shed_url: https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial"}
