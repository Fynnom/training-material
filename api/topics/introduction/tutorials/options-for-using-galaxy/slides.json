General purpose genomics servers\n1.

Tool servers\n   - Host specific tools to make them easy to access and run\n\nComplete list: [bit.ly/gxyServers ](https://bit.ly/gxyServers)\n\n???\n\n- There are three types of servers\n- First is general-purpose genomics servers.\n- The second is domain-specific servers, which can be specific to: Research methods, Organisms or Non-genomic domains\n- the third type is Tool servers , the tool servers host specific tools to make them easy to access and run\n\n---\n\n### Semi-public Galaxy services\n\nAccess based on geography or community membership\n\n| Geography  | Resource |\n| ---------- | -------- |\n| Australia  | [Genomics Virtual Lab (GVL)](https://launch.genome.edu.au/launch)  |\n| Canada | [GenAP](https://www.genap.ca/) |\n| Norway | [Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no/) |\n| US | [Jetstream](https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/jetstream/) |\n\nComplete list: [bit.ly/gxysemipublic ](https://bit.ly/gxysemipublic)\n\n???\n- There are some semi-public galaxy servers for which access is restricted according to the user's geographic location or community membership\n- In Australia there is the Genomics Virtual Lab\n- In Canada there is GenAP\n- In Norway there is Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences\n- In the US there is Jetstream\n\n---\n\n.pull-left[\n### Public clouds via CloudLaunch\n\n.left[[CloudLaunch](https://launch.usegalaxy.org/) currently only supports:]\n- Jetstream (covered above)\n- **Amazon Web Services** (AWS)\n  -

Paying to have a cloud instance up for two weeks that you only use for 8 hours is not cost effective\n- **It is very important to shut down and remove everything when you are done**\n\n???\n- CloudMan enables you to statically or dynamically scale compute power\n- Cloud instances can be incredibly cost effective only if you are actually using them when they are up.\n- you can't have a cloud instance up for two weeks when you only use for 8 hours\n- It is very important to shut down and remove everything when you are done\n---\n\n### Run your own Galaxy locally\n\n- Galaxy is [open source software](https://getgalaxy.org/) and can be installed on local compute infrastructure, from lab servers to institutional compute clusters\n- Installing Galaxy locally is relatively easy, but\n  - the initial install does not include reference genomes and only has a few tools\n  - installing tools and genomes, setting up authentication, and connecting to institutional compute resources all takes work\n- There are hundreds of local Galaxy installs around the world\n  - Installing tools and genomes has become much easier in recent years, and can now often be done with the Galaxy Admin GUI\n  - Authentication and connecting to institutional compute resources is still heavy lifting\n\n???\n- Galaxy is open source software which means it's free to use locally\n- it can be installed on local compute infrastructure, from lab servers to institutional compute clusters.\n- Installing Galaxy locally is relatively easy, but you have to consider this\n- the initial install does not include reference genomes and only has a few tools\n- installing tools and genomes, setting up authentication, and connecting to institutional compute resources all takes work\n- installing has become much easier and can now be done with the Galaxy Admin GUI\n- Authentication and connecting to institutional compute resources is still heavy lifting\n---\n\n### Commercial support\n\n- You can buy a preconfigured Galaxy server from [BioTeam](https://bioteam.net/) or [NABE<sup>3</sup> International](http://www.nabe-intl.co.jp/seq/takerugalaxy.html)\n- [Globus Genomics](http://globusgenomics.org/) provides cloud-based Galaxy servers\n- [Commercially provided consulting and training](https://galaxyproject.org/support/commercial/) are also available\n\n???\n- Commercial solutions are also available, for example:\n- You can buy a preconfigured Galaxy server from BioTeam\n- Globus Genomics also provides cloud-based Galaxy servers\n---\n\n### Which Galaxy instance to use?\n\n- Choose based on\n  - size of datasets, available storage, backup\n  - data security\n  - computational requirements\n  - tools installed\n???\n- In conclusion, choosing which Galaxy instance to use depends on multiple factors like: size of datasets, available storage, backup\n- you also need to consider data security, computational requirements, and the tools installed\n\n"],"video_library":{"tutorial":null,"slides":null,"demo":null,"both":null,"session":null},"hands_on":false,"slides":true,"mod_date":"2022-09-16 13:37:09 +0000","pub_date":"2017-05-24 15:51:24 +0000","version":37,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/introduction/tutorials/options-for-using-galaxy/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Introduction to Galaxy Analyses","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":true},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","redirect_from":["/short/introduction/options-for-using-galaxy/slides","/short/S00075"]}
