A contig does not contain long stretches of unknown sequences (aka assembly **gaps**).\n\n**Scaffold**: a sequence consists of one or multiple contigs connected by assembly gaps of typically inexact sizes. A scaffold is also called a **supercontig**, though this terminology is rarely used nowadays.\n\n**Assembly**: a set of contigs or scaffolds.\n]\n\n.image-60[\n  ![Illustration of the working principle of scaffolding](../../images/genome_assembly_introduction/scaffolding.png)\n]\n\n---\n\n.left[\n**Haplotig**: a contig that comes from the same haplotype. In an unphased assembly, a contig may join alleles from different parental haplotypes in a diploid or polyploid genome.\n\n**Primary assembly**: a complete assembly with long stretches of phased blocks.\n\n**Alternate assembly**: an incomplete assembly consisting of haplotigs in heterozygous regions. An alternate assembly always accompanies a primary assembly. It is not useful by itself as it is fragmented and incomplete.\n\n**Haplotype-resolved assembly**: sets of complete assemblies consisting of haplotigs, representing an entire diploid/polyploid genome.\n]\n\n.image-60[\n  ![Illustration of the assembly types](../../images/genome_assembly_introduction/assemblies_definitions.png)\n]\n\n---\n\n.left[\n**Telomere to telomere**: An assembly where each chromosome is fully phased and assembled without gaps.\n\n**Linkage group**: a set of contigs or scaffolds ordered and oriented using a collection of genes that are inferred to be located together on a single chromosome because of the pattern of their inheritance.\n]\n\n.image-20[\n  ![Example of linkage map from JCVI](../../images/genome_assembly_introduction/linkage_map.png)\n]\n\n---\n\n.left[\n**Coverage in terms of redundancy (A)**: number of reads that align to, or \"cover,\" a known reference.
