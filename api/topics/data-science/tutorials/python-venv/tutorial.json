This means\nthat you will have to use a <em>package manager</em> tool to install them on your system.\nApplications will also sometimes need a\nspecific version of an external library (e.g. because they require that a particular\nbug has been fixed in a newer version of the library), or a specific version of Python interpreter.\nThis means that each Python application you work with may require a different setup and a set of dependencies so it\nis important to be able to keep these configurations separate to avoid confusion between projects.\nThe solution for this problem is to create a self-contained <em>virtual\nenvironment</em> per project, which contains a particular version of Python installation plus a number of\nadditional external libraries.</p>\n\n<p>Virtual environments are not just a feature of Python - all modern programming languages use them to isolate code\nof a specific project and make it easier to develop, run, test and share code with others. In this tutorial, we learn how\nto set up a virtual environment to develop our code and manage our external dependencies.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\">\n  <agenda-title></agenda-title>\n\n  <p>In this tutorial, we will cover:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n  <li><a href=\"#virtual-environments\" id=\"markdown-toc-virtual-environments\">Virtual Environments</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#running-python-scripts-from-command-line\" id=\"markdown-toc-running-python-scripts-from-command-line\">Running Python Scripts From Command Line</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"virtual-environments\">Virtual Environments</h2>\n\n<p>So what exactly are virtual environments, and why use them?</p>\n\n<p>A Python virtual environment is an <strong>isolated working copy</strong> of a specific version of\nPython interpreter together with specific versions of a number of external libraries installed into that\nvirtual environment. A virtual environment is simply a <em>directory with a particular\nstructure</em> which includes links to and enables multiple side-by-side installations of\ndifferent Python interpreters or different versions of the same external library to coexist on your machine and only one to be selected for each of our projects. This allows you to work on a particular\nproject without worrying about affecting other projects on your machine.</p>\n\n<p>As more external libraries are added to your Python project over time, you can add them to\nits specific virtual environment and avoid a great deal of confusion by having separate (smaller) virtual environments\nfor each project rather than one huge global environment with potential package version clashes. Another big motivator\nfor using virtual environments is that they make sharing your code with others much easier (as we will see shortly).\nHere are some typical scenarios where the usage of virtual environments is highly recommended (almost unavoidable):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>You have an older project that only works under Python 2. You do not have the time to migrate the project to Python 3\nor it may not even be possible as some of the third party dependencies are not available under Python 3. You have to\nstart another project under Python 3. The best way to do this on a single machine is to set up two separate Python virtual\nenvironments.</li>\n  <li>One of your Python 3 projects is locked to use a particular older version of a third party dependency. You cannot use the\nlatest version of the\ndependency as it breaks things in your project. In a separate branch of your project, you want to try and fix problems\nintroduced by the new version of the dependency without affecting the working version of your project. You need to set up\na separate virtual environment for your branch to ‘isolate’ your code while testing the new feature.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You do not have to worry too much about specific versions of external libraries that your project depends on most of the time.\nVirtual environments enable you to always use the latest available version without specifying it explicitly.\nThey also enable you to use a specific older version of a package for your project, should you need to.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>A Specific Python or Package Version is Only Ever Installed Once</tip-title>\n  <p>Note that you will not have a separate Python or package installations for each of your projects - they will only\never be installed once on your system but will be referenced from different virtual environments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"managing-python-virtual-environments\">Managing Python Virtual Environments</h3>\n\n<p>There are several commonly used command line tools for managing Python virtual environments:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code>, available by default from the standard <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Python</code> distribution from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Python 3.3+</code></li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">virtualenv</code>, needs to be installed separately but supports both <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Python 2.7+</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Python 3.3+</code>versions</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pipenv</code>, created to fix certain shortcomings of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">virtualenv</code></li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code>, package and environment management system (also included as part of the Anaconda Python distribution often used by the scientific community)</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">poetry</code>, a modern Python packaging tool which handles virtual environments automatically</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While there are pros and cons for using each of the above, all will do the job of managing Python\nvirtual environments for you and it may be a matter of personal preference which one you go for.\nIn this course, we will use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> to create and manage our\nvirtual environment (which is the preferred way for Python 3.3+).</p>\n\n<p>Until you encounter the needs of a project which goes beyond what is available\nin the Python ecosystem, e.g. when you depend on external packages like htslib\nor bioinformatics tools that are simply not distributed as part of PyPI, then\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> is a good choice to get started with.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"managing-python-packages\">Managing Python Packages</h3>\n\n<p>Part of managing your (virtual) working environment involves installing, updating and removing external packages\non your system. The Python package manager tool <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> is most commonly used for this - it interacts\n and obtains the packages from the central repository called <a href=\"https://pypi.org/\">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>.\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> can now be used with all Python distributions (including Anaconda).</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>A Note on Anaconda and `conda`</tip-title>\n  <p>Anaconda is an open source Python\ndistribution commonly used for scientific programming - it conveniently installs Python, package and environment management <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code>, and a \nnumber of commonly used scientific computing packages so you do not have to obtain them separately. \n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code> is an independent command line tool (available separately from the Anaconda distribution too) with dual functionality: (1) it is a package manager that helps you find Python packages from\nremote package repositories and install them on your system, and (2) it is also a virtual environment manager. So, you can use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code> for both tasks instead of using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"many-tools-for-the-job\">Many Tools for the Job</h3>\n\n<p>Installing and managing Python distributions, external libraries and virtual environments is, well,\ncomplex. There is an abundance of tools for each task, each with its advantages and disadvantages, and there are different\nways to achieve the same effect (and even different ways to install the same tool!).\nNote that each Python distribution comes with its own version of\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> - and if you have several Python versions installed you have to be extra careful to use the correct <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> to\nmanage external packages for that Python version.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> are considered the <em>de facto</em> standards for virtual environment and package management for Python 3.\nHowever, the advantages of using Anaconda and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code> are that you get (most of the) packages needed for\nscientific code development included with the distribution. If you are only collaborating with others who are also using\nAnaconda, you may find that <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">conda</code> satisfies all your needs. It is good, however, to be aware of all these tools,\nand use them accordingly. As you become more familiar with them you will realise that equivalent tools work in a similar\nway even though the command syntax may be different (and that there are equivalent tools for other programming languages\ntoo to which your knowledge can be ported).</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/xkcd/python_environment.png\" alt=\"Python environment hell XKCD comic  showing boxes like pip, easy_install, homebrew 2.7, anaconda, homebrew 3.6, /usr/local/Cellar, ~/python/, and a chaotic mess of arrows moving between them all.

Using “venv” or “.venv” as the\nname for an environment and storing it within the project’s directory seems to be the recommended way -\nthis way when you come across such a subdirectory within a software project,\nby convention you know it contains its virtual environment details.\nA slight downside is that all different virtual environments\non your machine then use the same name and the current one is determined by the context of the path\nyou are currently located in. A (non-conventional) alternative is to\nuse your project name for the name of the virtual environment, with the downside that there is nothing to indicate\nthat such a directory contains a virtual environment. In our case, we have settled to use the name “venv” since it is \nnot a hidden directory and we want it to be displayed by the command line when listing directory contents (hence, \nno need for the “.” in its name that would, by convention, make it hidden).

For example, one of your project’s dependencies has\njust released a new version (dependency version number update), you need an additional package for data analysis\n(adding a new dependency) or you have found a better package and no longer need the older package (adding a new and\nremoving an old dependency). What you need to do in this case (apart from installing the new and removing the\npackages that are no longer needed from your virtual environment) is update the contents of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">requirements.txt</code> file\naccordingly by re-issuing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip freeze</code> command and propagate the updated <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">requirements.txt</code> file to your collaborators\nvia your code sharing platform (e.g. GitHub).</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>Official Documentation</tip-title>\n  <p>For a full list of options and commands, consult the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\">official <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">venv</code> documentation</a>\nand the <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#installing-index\">Installing Python Modules with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pip</code> guide</a>.
