For example, [IWCG](https://dockstore.org/organizations/iwc)\n\n---\n\n## Why use Dockstore?\n\nDockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).\n\n## Accessible\n\n- Dockstore never requires a user to log in to search and inspect contents for workflows and tools.\n\n- Once found, analyses can be launched in different environments using the Launch with feature of Dockstore. Workflows can just as easily be downloaded to run on local machines.\n\n- Users can also request a DOI via Zenodo for their workflows for reference in published research.\n\n---\n\n## Why use Dockstore?\n\nDockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).\n\n## Interoperable\n\n- Users are strongly encouraged to provide clear instructions, test data and checker workflows to ensure that their workflows are usable in any environment.\n\n- The GA4GH TRS API enable the simple launching of workflows to a variety of compute platforms.\n\n---\n\n## Why use Dockstore?\n\nDockstore follows the FAIR Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).\n\n## Reusable\n\n- Contributors are encouraged to provide clear documentation and the exact version of the components in their descriptor files so that others can find, reuse and build upon the workflows.\n\n- The Dockstore GitHub App provides support for registering workflows, version control/tagging and automatically syncing workflows and services.\n\n---\n\n# How to find workflows on [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/)?\n\n---\n\n## How
