Tags can be another useful way to\norganize and search your data. For instance, you might tag a history with the type of analysis you did in it: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">assembly</code>\nor <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">variants</code>. Or you may tag them according to data sources or some other metadata: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">long-term-care-facility</code> or\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">yellowstone park:2014</code>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>Best Practices for Tagging</comment-title>\n  <p>It is strongly recommended to replace spaces in tags with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">_</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-</code>, as spaces will automatically be removed when the tag is saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To tag a history:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Click the tag button at the top of the history panel.

Galaxy allows you to create history\nannotations: longer text entries that allow for more formatting options. The formatting of the text is preserved. Later, if\nyou publish or share the history, the annotation will be displayed automatically - allowing you to share additional\nnotes about the analysis.</p>\n\n<p>To annotate a history:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Click the annotation button at the top of the history panel. A larger text section will appear displaying any\n  existing annotation (or, if there‚Äôs none, italic text saying you can click on the control to create an annotation).</li>\n  <li>Click the annotation section.

The total size of these files,\nfor all the datasets in a history, is displayed underneath the history name.

If you‚Äôre using more than the quota allows, Galaxy will prevent you from running any new jobs until you‚Äôve deleted some\ndatasets and brought that total below the quota.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"history-panel-datasets\">History Panel Datasets</h2>\n\n<p>Datasets in the history panel show the state of the job that has generated or will generate the data.</p>\n\n<p>There are several different ‚Äòstates‚Äô a dataset can be in:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>When you first upload a file or run a tool, the dataset will be in the <strong>queued</strong> state. This indicates that the\n  job that will create this dataset has not yet started and is in line to begin.</li>\n  <li>When the job starts, the dataset will be in the <strong>running</strong> state. The job that created these datasets is now\n  running on Galaxy‚Äôs cluster.</li>\n  <li>When the job has completed successfully, the datasets it generated will be in the <strong>ok</strong> state.</li>\n  <li>If there‚Äôs been an error while running the tool, the datasets will be in the <strong>error</strong> state.</li>\n  <li>If a previously running or queued job has been paused by Galaxy, the dataset will be in the <strong>paused</strong> state.\n  You can re-start/resume paused jobs using the options menu above the history panel and selecting ‚ÄòResume Paused Jobs‚Äô.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-5\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/states.png\" alt=\"5 datasets are shown in a history, one in each of the aforementioned dataset states.

These hidden datasets won‚Äôt normally appear in the history panel\nbut theyre still mentioned in the history subtitle (the smaller, grey text that appears below the history name). If\nyour history has hidden datasets, the number will appear there (e.g. ‚Äò3 hidden‚Äô) as a clickable link. If you click this link,\nthe hidden datasets are shown. Each hidden dataset has a link in the top of the summary view that allows you to unhide\nit. You can click that link again (which will now be ‚Äòhide hidden‚Äô) to make them not shown again.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-8\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/hide.png\" alt=\"Two histories side by side, one shows a message saying &quot;this history is empty&quot;, on the right the history search has been replaced by visible:false and now one history is visible.\" width=\"768\" height=\"505\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../images/hide.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 8</strong>:</span> Hiding and unhiding datasets.

This does not immediately remove the\ndataset‚Äôs data from Galaxy and <strong>it is reversible</strong>. When you delete a dataset from the history, it will be removed\nfrom the panel but (like hidden datasets) the total number of deleted datasets is shown in the history subtitle as a\nlink. Clicking this link (e.g. ‚Äò3 deleted‚Äô) will make the deleted datasets visible and each deleted dataset will have a\nlink for manually undeleting it, above its title. You can click that link again (which will now be ‚Äòhide deleted‚Äô) to\nmake them not shown again.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-9\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/delete.png\" alt=\"Two histories side by side, the left shows the same &quot;this history is empty&quot; message.

Often, deleted datasets and histories are purged based on the age of the deletion\n(e.g. datasets that have been marked as deleted for 90 days or more). Check with the administrators of your Galaxy instance to\nfind out the policy used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tagging-datasets\">Tagging datasets</h3>\n\n<p>There are two types of tags that can be used as an additional level of labeling for datasets: <strong>standard tags</strong> and <strong>hashtags</strong>. The standard tags work similarly to history tags described above - they add another level of description to datasets making them easier to find. <strong>Hashtags</strong> (also known as <strong>name tags</strong> or <strong>propagating tags</strong>) are much more powerful as they <strong>propagate</strong> through the analysis:</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-10\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/name_tags.png\" alt=\"Close up of the history showing tag:#üêá in the search field, and four discovered datasets.

Hashtags are added similarly to standard tags but with one important difference: they are prepended with a hash '#' symbol. Here you see a history where two datasets were given tags, some hash tags and some normal tags. The hashtag propagates, when a computation is done, while the standard tags do not.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>For more information on name tags, a <a href=\"/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/name-tags/tutorial.html\">dedicated nametag tutorial is available</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"managing-multiple-datasets-easily\">Managing Multiple Datasets Easily</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"multi-selection\">Multi-selection</h3>\n\n<p>You can also hide, delete, and purge multiple datasets at once by <strong>multi-selecting datasets</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><i class=\"far fa-check-square\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">galaxy-selector</span> Click the multi-select button containing the checkbox just below the history size.</li>\n  <li>Checkboxes will appear inside each dataset in the history.</li>\n  <li>Scroll and click the checkboxes next to the datasets you want to manage.</li>\n  <li>Click the ‚Äòn of N selected‚Äô to choose the action.
