SRA datasets should use the upload tool, if you have many or big datasets use FTP, if they're from the web use the URL upload.](../../images/get_data_upload_logic.png)\n\n.footnote[[Source: Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/tutorials/upload/)]\n\n---\n\n# 1. The ***Get Data*** toolbox section\n\n---\n\n\n- *Click* on the **Get Data** toolbox in the toolbox (the left panel)\n\n![Click on Get Data to expand it](../../images/get_data_boxed.png)\n\n---\n\n.pull-right[.image-75[![A typical list of data sources](../../images/get_data_expanded.png)]]\n\n- Expands to show data sources\n  - E.g. UCSC, NCBI, Uniprot, ..\n  - The specific data sources available on your Galaxy instance are determine by the server's administrator\n\n- All of these data sources can bring datasets (files) into your Galaxy workspace (history)\n\n???\n\nThis shows the list of data sources that were available on usegalaxy.org in mid 2017.\n\n---\n\nTwo large data sources you can access through Galaxy are UCSC and SRA\n\n.pull-right[![Screenshot of toolbox with ucsc entered in search](../../images/get_data_ucsc.png)]\n.pull-left[![galaxy toolbox with sra entered in search box.](../../images/get_data_sra.png)]\n\n---\n\n# 2. Import from Shared Data Library\n\n---\n\n.pull-left[\n\n- Top menu bar -> Shared Data -> Data Libraries\n\n- Configured by a Galaxy Administator\n\n- Can be imported directly into your history\n\n- Example: all GTN tutorial data]\n\n\n.pull-right[![galaxy top menu dropdown shared data, showing Data Libraries](../../images/get_data_data_libraries.png)]\n\n---\n\nYou can select the files you want and send to History as datasets or collection\n\n.image-75[![data library screenshot with a number of datasets selected and export to history menu open](../../images/get_data_import_library.png)]\n\n---\n\n\n# 3. Upload from your computer\n\n---\n\n.image-50[![click on upload button](../../images/upload_button.png)]\n\n![Upload file form](../../images/upload_file_form_empty.png)\n\n???\n\n- The **Upload File** data source can import data:\n  - from your computer\n  - by directly entering text\n  - using a URL\n  - and via FTP\n\nThis is probably the most commonly used tool for bringing data into Galaxy, and it is installed on almost every Galaxy server.\n\n---\n\n# Choose files\n\n\n![Options for importing files from your laptop](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_local_choices.png)\n\n???\n\n- Drag and drop is supported\n- as is the standard file selection using your browser.\n\n---\n\n# Set Metadata\n\n- **Datatype** (e.g. FastQ, VCF, BAM, tabular, ..)\n  - Galaxy will autodetect by default (sometimes guesses wrong)\n- **Genome Build** (e.g. hg19, mm9, ..)\n  - must be set manually (can be done later as well)\n\n![upload dialog from galaxy with a number of files queued.](../../images/upload_file_file_list.png)\n\n???\n\n- Here we have imported 13 files\n  - one with genome annotation in GTF format\n  - 12 paired end read files from an RNA-Seq experiment*\n  - could import them now and have Galaxy guess at their file types.\n\n  * From UC Davis Training Material.\n\n\n---\n\n- Can be set for all files at once:\n\n![Set datatype for all imported datasets](../../images/upload_file_set_all_datatype.png)\n\n---\n\n- Or per file:\n\n![Manually set datatype for one dataset](../../images/upload_file_set_individual_file_type.png)\n\n???\n\n- Here we are manually setting the first dataset's datatype to GTF, a common genome annotation format.\n\n---\n\n# Start upload process:\n\n- Once everything is ready, click the **Start** button\n\n![Ready to upload files. Click on start](../../images/upload_file_ready.png)\n\n???\n\n- Data transfer does not start until you click Start.\n\n---\nYou can then close the form\n\n![Ready to upload files. Click on start](../../images/upload_file_in_progress.png)\n\n???\n\n---\n\nAll the items will appear in your history\n\n![Files are loaded into your current history.](../../images/files_uploaded_into_history.png)\n\nand are ready to use when green.\n\n---\n\n## Directly enter text\n\n---\n\n- Sometimes it's useful to file content directly.\n  - only works if your dataset is tiny\n  - choose **Paste/Fetch data**\n\n![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_paste.png)\n\n---\n\nEnter the data by typing (or pasting) it in the input box:\n\n![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_paste_direct.png)\n\nYou can also set the datatype and build.\n*Click* **Start**, and then **Close**, and the new item shows up as **Pasted Entry** in your history.\n\n---\n\n## Import using URL\n\n---\n\nThe data might already be available on a web server somewhere. To avoid downloading data\nto your computer and uploading to Galaxy in two steps, you can instruct Galaxy to\ndirectly fetch the data from a given URL.\n\n\n![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/upload_file_form_empty_paste.png)\n\n Select **Paste/Fetch data**\n\n\n---\n\nEnter the URLs (one per line) into the input box:\n\n![Select Paste/Fetch data](../../images/fetch_from_url.png)\n\n*Click* **Start**, and then **Close**, and the new items show up in your history with the URL as their name.\n\n---\n\n# Import using FTP\n\n---\n\n- Why use FTP?\n  - Older Galaxies did not support uploading files larger than 2GB in size\n  - Many people are very comfortable using FTP to upload large datasets and you can sometimes resume interrupted uploads.\n\n- How to use FTP\n  - The Galaxy server's administrator must have [enabled FTP](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/upload-via-ftp/) on the server\n  - You will need to create an account on that Galaxy Server\n  - You will need to install FTP software, or to run FTP from the shell\n  - See https://galaxyproject.org/ftp-upload/\n\n---\n\n## Make sure you have an FTP client installed\n\n.pull-right[.image-25[![FileZilla](../../images/FileZilla_logo.png)]]\n\n- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) is a free FTP client that is available on [Windows](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64), [MacOS](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=osx), and [Linux](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=linux)\n- There are many other options\n- If you don't already have an FTP client, download and install FileZilla.\n\n---\n\n## Establish FTP connection to your Galaxy server\n\n- Provide\n  - the instance's FTP server name (e.g. usegalaxy.org, ftp.usegalaxy.eu)\n  - your full **username** (usually an email address) and **password**\n\n![FTP Connection Params](../../images/ftp_client_connect.png)\n\n---\n\n![Successfully connect](../../images/ftp_client_connected.png)\n\nSuccessfully connected\n\n---\n\n![Navigate to the files you want to transfer](../../images/ftp_client_upload.png)\n\nRight click on the files and upload them.\n\n---\n\n![FTP transfer in progress](../../images/ftp_client_transferring.png)\n\nFTP Transfer in progress...\n\n---\n\n![FTP transfer complete](../../images/ftp_client_transferred.png)\n\n... and transfer complete.\n\n---\n\n# Where did my files go?\n\n- File Upload menu -> **Choose FTP files**\n\n![choose FTP files](../../images/upload_ftp_import.png)\n\n---\n\n- Select files to import into your history\n- Click **Start**\n\n![choose FTP files](../../images/upload_ftp_import2.png)\n\n???\n\nAs you can see, this dialog gives connection settings too\n\n---\n\n# Import directly into Collection\n\n---\n\n- Select **Collection** tab at top of upload menu\n- Add files as before (upload from computer, paste/fetch, FTP)\n\n![Direct collection Start](../../images/get_data_direct_collection1.png)\n\n---\n\n- Choose collection type (at bottom)\n- Set metadata (file type, genome build)\n- Click \"Build\"\n\n![Direct collection Build](../../images/get_data_direct_collection2.png)\n\n---\n\n- Name your collection\n- Click **Create** button\n\n![Direct collection Name](../../images/get_data_direct_collection3.png)\n\n---\n\n- Collection is now imported in your history\n- Click on it to expand it and view all files in collection\n\n![Direct collection History](../../images/get_data_direct_collection4.png)\n\n---\n\n# Import using Rule Based uploader\n\n---\n\n- When you want to import many files from URLs or Accession IDs directly into collection(s)\n- Supports advanced \"rules\" for creating collections from sample sheets\n- Click **Rule-based** tab at top of file upload window\n\n![Rule Uploader](../../images/get_data_rule_uploader.png)\n\n---\n\n# Import using Rule Based uploader\n\nLearn how to use it in the dedicated [Rule Based Uploader tutorial](/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-rules/tutorial.html)\n\n"],"video_library":{"tutorial":null,"slides":null,"demo":null,"both":null,"session":null},"hands_on":false,"slides":true,"mod_date":"2022-10-06 18:21:23 +0000","pub_date":"2017-05-24 15:51:24 +0000","version":8,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/get-data/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Using Galaxy and Managing your Data","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial"}
