These data have proven essential for surveilling the emergence and spread of new viral variants, and for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the virus.</p>\n\n<p>The tutorial <a href=\"/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2/tutorial.html\">SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data analysis</a> shows in detail how you can identify mutations in SARS-CoV-2 samples from paired-end whole-genome sequencing data generated on the Illumina platform.</p>\n\n<p>For versatile and efficient genome surveillance, however, you would want to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>be able to analyze data of different origin</p>\n\n    <p>Besides WGS paired-end Illumina data, different labs are generating also single-end Illumina and ONT data, and are combining these platforms with various tiled-amplicon approaches upstream of sequencing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>go beyond per-sample mutation calls in variant call format (VCF)</p>\n\n    <p>To keep track of large numbers of samples sequenced in batches (as, nowadays, produced routinely by SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance initiatives across the globe), you need concise reports and visualizations of results at the sample and batch level.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>use sample mutation patterns to construct sample consensus genomes</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>use the consensus genomes to assign the samples to SARS-CoV-2 lineages as defined by major lineage classification systems (<a href=\"https://nextstrain.org/blog/2022-04-29-SARS-CoV-2-clade-naming-2022\">Nextstrain clades</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pango.network/\">PANGO</a>)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>decrease hands-on time and data manipulation errors by combining analysis steps into workflows for automated execution</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how a set of workflows developed by the <a href=\"https://galaxyproject.org/projects/covid19/\">Galaxy Covid-19 project</a> can be combined and used together with a handful of additional tools to achieve all of the above. Specifically, we will cover the analysis flow presented in figure 1.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/schema.png\" alt=\"Analysis flow in the tutorial. \" width=\"768\" height=\"713\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../images/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/schema.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> Analysis flow in the tutorial</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>Depending on the type of sequencing data <strong>one of four variation analysis workflows</strong> can be run to discover mutations in a batch of input samples. Outputs of any of these workflows can then be processed further with two additional workflows: the <strong>variation reporting workflow</strong> generates a per-sample report of mutations, but also batch-level reports and visualizations, while the <strong>consensus construction workflow</strong> reconstructs the full viral genomes of all samples in the batch by modifying the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with each sample’s set of mutations.</p>\n\n<p>A few highlights of these workflows are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>All the variation analysis workflows are more sensitive than they need to be for consensus sequence generation, i.e. they can not only be used to capture fixed or majority alleles, but can also be used on their own to address less routine questions such as co-infections with two viral lineages or shifting intrahost allele-frequencies in, for example, immunocompromised, longterm-infected patients.</li>\n  <li>The reporting workflow produces a batch-level overview plot of mutations and their observed allele-frequencies that enables spotting of batch-effects like sample cross-contamination and outlier samples that are different from the rest of the batch.</li>\n  <li>The consensus workflow can express uncertainty about any base position in the generated consensus sequence by N-masking the position according to user-defined thresholds.</li>\n  <li>All of the workflows are openly developed and available in the form of defined releases through major public workflow registries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this tutorial you will learn to</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>obtain releases of the workflows from public registries</li>\n  <li>set up input data for different types of sequencing protocols</li>\n  <li>run and combine the workflows</li>\n  <li>understand the various outputs produced by the workflows and to extract insight about viral samples from them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\">\n  <agenda-title></agenda-title>\n\n  <p>In this tutorial, we will

scheme file is 6-column BED format, while the amplicon info file is a simple tabular format that lists all primer names (which must be identical to the ones used in the primer scheme file) that contribute to formation of the same amplicon on a single tab-separated line.\nIf in doubt, download the ARTIC v4 files through the URLs provided below, and use them as a template for your own custom

BA.1 is the Omicron lineage that was dominant in South Africa when that new variant of concern was first discovered.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Again, this is straightforward to answer from the lineage summary:</p>\n\n        <p>The three samples are <strong>SRR17051933</strong> (which got assigned to lineage B.1), and <strong>SRR17054505</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong> (both of which pangolin left unassigned).</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>We have encountered <strong>SRR17054505</strong> and <strong>SRR17054508</strong> previously as samples with low sequencing coverage.</p>\n\n        <p>When we ran pangolin, we used the default value for <em>“Maximum proportion of Ns allowed”</em> of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">0.3</code>.\nIf you look up the two samples in the original output of pangolin and scroll to the right, you should see that they have a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">fail</code> in the <strong>qc_status</strong> column and the <strong>qc_notes</strong> column explains that they had fractions of <em>Ambiguous content</em> (i.e. Ns) of 0.95 and 0.66, respectively.\nIn other words, pangolin refused (and rightly so) to perform lineage assignment for these two samples based on the very limited sequencing information available.</p>\n\n        <p><strong>SRR17051933</strong>, on the other hand, has passed pangolin’s quality control with very low <em>Ambiguous content</em> so we might tend to believe the assignment.\nHowever, if you remember earlier questions or re-inspect the variant-frequency plot generated by the reporting workflow, you will find that this sample was the outlier sample that had more or less the same mutations called as the other samples in the batch, but nearly all of them at rather low allele-frequencies.\nIn fact, the only seemingly fixed mutations (with allele-frequencies close to one) are ancestral mutations that have been present in SARS-CoV-2 isolates since the Spring of 2020.\nSince only these mutations made it into the consensus sequence for that sample, pangolin has based the assignment only on them and has infered the ancestral lineage B.1 as a result.</p>\n\n        <p>Whether or not this is the correct assignment for this sample is hard to tell without additional information.\nSeveral possibilities exist:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>the sample could indeed be from a pre-Omicron lineage and might have been lab-contaminated with DNA from one of the other (Omicron) samples processed together with it.</li>\n          <li>the sample might have been taken from a patient who was infected with Omicron and a pre-Omicron lineage simultaneously.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>Remember the questions about the outputs of the <em>reporting</em> workflow. As part of one of them, you were suggested to generate a report for mutations seen <em>only</em> in <strong>SRR17051933</strong>. It turned out that these were mostly observed at an allele frequency of ~ 0.75. This makes the first possibility seem somewhat more plausible: a pre-Omicron sample has been contaminated with traces of Omicron sequence, but most reads still come from the original strain. For the co-infection scenario, on the other hand, a lot would depend on the relative timing of the two infections.</p>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"lineage-assignment-with-nextclade\">Lineage assignment with Nextclade</h3>\n\n<p>Nextclade assigns clades, calls mutations and performs sequence quality checks on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>From consensus sequences to clade assignments using Nextclade</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li><span class=\"tool\" data-tool=\"toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/nextclade/nextclade/2.7.0+galaxy0\" title=\"Nextclade tool\" aria-role=\"button\"><i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Nextclade</strong> (<i class=\"fas fa-cubes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Galaxy version 2.7.0+galaxy0)</span> with the following parameters:\n      <ul>\n        <li><i class=\"far fa-file\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">param-file</span> <em>“FASTA file with input sequences”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Multisample consensus FASTA</code></li>\n        <li><em>“Version of database to use”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Download latest available database version from web</code></li>\n        <li><i class=\"far fa-check-square\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">param-check</span> <em>“Output options”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Tabular format report</code></li>\n        <li><em>“Include header line in output file”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Yes</code></li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Inspect the generated output</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nextclade assigns lineages using an algorithm that differs from the one used by pangolin, and it uses a different “native” nomenclature system.

However, we already know from the discussion of coverage and pangolin results for this sample that this assignment cannot make sense.</p>\n\n    <p>Nextclade simply doesn’t have pangolin’s concept of leaving samples unassigned, and this is why it produced (highly unreliable) assignments for both <strong>SRR17054508</strong> and <strong>SRR17054505</strong>.\nHowever, if you inspect the original output of Nextclade, you’ll see that the tool classified both samples as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bad</code> in terms of their <strong>qc.overallStatus</strong>.\nWe could, thus, have used this column to filter out unreliable assignments to avoid the risk of overinterpreting the data.</p>\n\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion-and-outlook\">Conclusion and outlook</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-we-have-covered\">What we have covered</h2>\n\n<p>In this tutorial, we used a collection of Galaxy workflows for the detection and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants.</p>\n\n<p>The workflows can be freely used and are immediately accessible through global Galaxy instances.</p>\n\n<p>Combined, they enable rapid, reproducible, high-quality and flexible analysis of a range of different input data.</p>\n\n<p>The combined analysis flow is compatible with a high-throughput of samples, but still allows for detailed dives into effects seen in only particular samples, and enables qualified users to draw valid conclusions about individual samples and whole batches of data at the same time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"further-automation\">Further automation</h2>\n\n<p>If at this point you are convinced of the quality of the analysis, but you are thinking that manually triggering those sequential workflow runs through the Galaxy user interface is still a lot of work when scaling to many batches of sequencing data, you may want to start learning about leveraging Galaxy’s API to automate and orchestrate workflow executions.\nThe GTN material has <a href=\"/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/workflow-automation/tutorial.html\">a dedicated tutorial</a> that explains triggering workflow runs from the command line via the API.</p>\n\n<p>The workflows presented here and API-based orchestration scripts are also among the main building blocks used by the Galaxy Covid-19 project to build a truly high-throughput, automated and reusable SARS-CoV-2 genome surveillance system, which has been used to analyze several hundreds of thousands of public SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets over the course of the pandemic and about which you can learn more on the corresponding <a href=\"https://www.infectious-diseases-toolkit.org/showcase/covid19-galaxy\">Infectious Diseases Toolkit
