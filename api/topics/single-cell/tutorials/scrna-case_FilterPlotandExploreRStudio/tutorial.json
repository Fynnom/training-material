In their initial workflow, and in the Scanpy version of this tutorial, these steps are run individually.

SCTransform regularizes the gene expression profiles via a negative binomial regression while also controlling for overfitting of the data. This step can also be done using Seurat’s NormalizeData() function, but would need to be followed by FindVariableFeatures() and ScaleData().</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We also have loads of genes, but not all of them vary in expression from cell to cell. For instance, housekeeping genes are defined as not changing much from cell to cell, so we could disclude these from our data to simplify our analyses.</p>\n\n<p>The find variable features step within SCTransform (or Seurat’s FindVariableFeatures() function) will flag genes that <em>do</em> vary across cells, expediting future analyses and ensuring that we, and Seurat, don’t waste time looking for meaningful differences where they don’t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, SCTransform (or Seurat’s ScaleData() function) will scale the data so that all genes have the same variance and a zero mean.</p>\n\n<p>This is an important step to set up our data for further dimensionality reduction. It also helps negate sequencing depth differences between samples, since the gene levels across the cells become comparable.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>Don't Worry!</comment-title>\n  <p>Note, that the differences from scaling etc. are not the values you have at the end - i.e. if your cell has average GAPDH levels, it will not appear as a ‘0’ when you calculate gene differences between clusters.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although we’ve made our expression values comparable to one another and our overall dataset less computationally demanding, we still have <em>way</em> too many dimensions (n cells x n genes!).</p>\n\n<p>Transcript changes are not usually singular–which is to say, genes function and exist in pathways and groups. It would be easier to analyse our data if we could group these differences. To address this we will run principal component analysis (PCA).</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>What is PCA?</comment-title>\n  <p>Principal components (PCs) are calculated from high dimensional data to find the most representative spread in the dataset.

Every algorithm for identifying cell clusters falls short of a biologist knowing their data, knowing what cells should be where, and consequently proving it in the lab.</p>\n\n<p>So, we’re going to make the best of it as a starting point and see what happens! We will define clusters from the kNN graph, based on how many connections cells have with one another. Roughly, this will depend on a resolution parameter for how granular you want to be.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>On Clustering Resolution</tip-title>\n  <p>The resolution parameter available in the FindClusters() function allows for you, the bioinformatician, to dictate the granularity of the clusters.</p>\n\n  <p>For example, a higher clustering resolution dictates increased granularity, and more stringent clusters. That is–cells must more closely resemble one another in order to be grouped into the same cluster than at a lower clustering resolution.</p>\n\n  <p>In general, I find it easiest to think of a higher resolution producing more clusters and conversely, a lower resolution will produce less clusters. This parameter is a useful one that you will use often to help decipher how many true populations of cells are present in your data!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that we have made note within our object of which cells cluster together, we can start to really visualize the data! Two major visualizations for this data type are tSNE and UMAP. We can calculate the coordinates for both prior to visualization. For tSNE, the parameter perplexity can be changed to best represent the data, while for UMAP the main change would be to change the kNN graph above itself, via the FindNeighbors() function.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>On UMAP</tip-title>\n  <p>UMAP is the most recently developed, and most widely used dimensionality reduction for visualization of principal component data.

This might explain the dramatic shift in early to middle T-Cell between wildtype and knockout cells–the leftmost early to middle T-cells simply have a higher sequencing depth represented by Individual 3 (UMIs/cell) than the ones on the right side.

But looking at the biology here, we struggled to find marker genes to distinguish the double positive populations, which we know are also affected by depth of sequencing. That’s a reasonable argument that Clusters 1, 2, and 5 might not be all that different. Maybe we need more depth of sequencing across all those cells, or to compare these explicitly to each other (consider variations on FindMarkers!).</p>\n\n<p>However, the late double positive cluster is both seemingly leaving the larger body of clusters and also has fewer knockout cells, so we might go and look at what those cells are expressing in the marker gene list. If we look at the mature T-cells further, we can see that their marker gene–Itm2a–is only expressed in half of the cluster. You might consider sub-clustering this to investigate further, either through changing the resolution or through analysing this cluster alone.</p>\n\n<p>If we look at the differences between genotypes alone (the pseudo-bulk), we can see that many, if not most, of the genes in that list are actually ribosomal. This could be housekeeping background, it might be cell cycle related, it may be biological, or some combination of all three. You might consider investigating the cycling status of the cells, or even regressing this out (which is what the authors did).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there are quite a lot ways to analyse your scRNA-seq data, both within the confines of this tutorial (the many parameters that could be changed throughout) and outside of it (batch correction, sub-clustering, cell-cycle scoring, inferred trajectories, etc.) Most analyses will still yield the same general output, though: there are fewer knockout cells in the mature T-cell population, suggesting some sort of abberant development of T-cells in the Igf2-p0 hets.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we can export plots and objects from RStudio back into Galaxy.

You have interpreted your scRNA-seq data in several important ways!</p>\n"],"ref_slides":[],"video_library":{"tutorial":null,"slides":null,"demo":null,"both":null,"session":null},"hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-06-06 21:32:12 +0000","pub_date":"2023-10-02 09:11:50 +0000","version":14,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_FilterPlotandExploreRStudio/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Single Cell","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","contributors":[{"name":"Camila Goclowski","joined":"2023-01","email":"camila.goclowski@gmail.com","linkedin":"camila-goclowski","id":"Camila-goclowski","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/Camila-goclowski.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/Camila-goclowski/"},{"name":"Wendi Bacon","email":"wendi.bacon@open.ac.uk","twitter":"WendiBacon1","matrix":"nomadscientist:matrix.org","joined":"2020-03","elixir_node":"uk","orcid":"0000-0002-8170-8806","bio":"Lecturer at The Open University","fediverse":"https://mstdn.science/@wendibacon1","fediverse_flavor":"mastodon","affiliations":["elixir-europe"],"id":"nomadscientist","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/nomadscientist.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/nomadscientist/"},{"name":"Helena Rasche","orcid":"0000-0001-9760-8992","maintainer_contact":"gitter","matrix":"hexylena:matrix.org","joined":"2017-09","elixir_node":"nl","affiliations":["gallantries","by-covid","erasmusmc","elixir-europe","elixir-converge"],"former_affiliations":["deNBI","avans-atgm","uni-freiburg"],"contact_for_training":false,"location":{"country":"NL","lat":51.91,"lon":4.46},"id":"hexylena","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/hexylena.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/"},{"name":"Mehmet Tekman","email":"mtekman89@gmail.com","joined":"2018-11","elixir_node":"de","affiliations":["uni-freiburg"],"former_affiliations":["elixir-europe"],"id":"mtekman","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/mtekman.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/mtekman/"},{"name":"Saskia Hiltemann","maintainer_contact":"gitter","email":"saskia.hiltemann@gmail.com","fediverse":"https://mstdn.science/@shiltemann","fediverse_flavor":"mastodon","bluesky":"shiltemann.bsky.social","linkedin":"shiltemann","matrix":"shiltemann:matrix.org","orcid":"0000-0003-3803-468X","joined":"2017-09","bio":"Researcher at Erasmus Medical Center","elixir_node":"nl","contact_for_training":true,"affiliations":["CINECA-Project","gallantries","erasmusmc","elixir-europe","uni-freiburg"],"location":{"country":"NL","lat":51.912,"lon":4.462},"id":"shiltemann","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/shiltemann.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/shiltemann/"},{"name":"Pavankumar Videm","orcid":"0000-0002-5192-126X","joined":"2017-09","affiliations":["uni-freiburg","elixir-europe"],"id":"pavanvidem","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/pavanvidem.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/pavanvidem/"}]}
