Red reads were aligned in the forward strand, and blue ones in the reverse strand.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s suppose you want to improve the annotation of one of the gene. To do it, you can either click on one of its intron and drag and drop it to the User-created Annotations track (yellow background, at the top), or if you prefer, right click on one of its intron and select <strong>Create new annotation</strong> &gt; <strong>gene</strong>.

Click on the <strong>Sync name with transcript</strong> button to copy the gene name to the mRNA name. It should now display in the <strong>User-created Annotation</strong> track.

If you zoom to the 5’ end of the gene, you will notice two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a few RNA-Seq reads were mapped a little before the 5’ limit of our gene</li>\n  <li>there is another potential start codon a few bases after the one that was predicted by Funannotate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let’s modify the 5’ of the gene to add a 5’ untranslated region. Although we don’t have enough evidences to be sure that the start codon should be changed, for this exercise will we do it too. To do it, all you need to do is click on the 5’ limit of the gene and drag it to the desired position. You will notice that the structure of the gene will be shortly changed. Changing the start codon can be done by right clicking on the new position and clicking on “Set Translation Start”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/apollo/change_start_euk.gif\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/apollo/change_start_euk.gif\" alt=\"Gif showing modifying the 5' region of a gene by dragging it.\" width=\"1064\" height=\"580\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The new white region corresponds to the newly create 5’ untranslated region.</p>\n\n<p>This kind of modifications is very common when using Apollo, and you can perform it at the gene level, and at the exon/intron level (an exclaim mark appears when Apollo detects that an exon/intron junction doesn’t match with the cannonical acceptor/donor sequences).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/apollo/exon_edit.gif\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/apollo/exon_edit.gif\" alt=\"Gif showing modifying a exon/intron junction of a gene by dragging it.\" width=\"486\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>To guide you doing these changes, you should look at all the tracks available for the genome you study. RNA-Seq track are very helpful to determine the limits of coding sequences on the genome. Other tracks can be helpful, like alignements of transcripts or proteins from closely related species (or even big databanks like Swissprot or NR).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"working-with-isoforms\">Working with isoforms</h2>\n\n<p>In the eukaryote world, with the process of alternative splicing, multiple mRNA sequences (isoforms) can be generated for a single gene, based on the use of various splice site combinations. This process has a complex regulation mechanism allowing to express or not each isoform depending on multiple conditions (tissue, developmental stage, environmental conditions, …).</p>\n\n<p>Often automatic annotation softwares produce gene models composed of many exons, but does not give the detail of the sequence of each potential isoforms. However, in some cases, the RNA-Seq data and the scientific knowledge on specific gene families can be used to annotate each isoform of a gene.</p>\n\n<p>Apollo allows to do that: just duplicate an existing gene model at the same position. Each copy will be considered as an isoform of the same gene. You can then make all the modifications you want to each one independently.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/apollo/isoforms.gif\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/apollo/isoforms.gif\" alt=\"Gif showing creating two isoforms and removing exons from them.\" width=\"577\" height=\"386\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The isoforms will appear in the gene list, under their common gene.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/apollo/isoform_list.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/apollo/isoform_list.png\" alt=\"Gene list showing the three isoforms of the same gene.\" width=\"438\" height=\"135\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As isoforms regulation depends heavily on multiple conditions (tissue, developmental stage, environmental conditions, …), it is important when annotating a new genome to have access to a lot of RNA-Seq data sequenced in multiple conditions and from different tissues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"viewing-and-reverting-changes\">Viewing and reverting changes</h2>\n\n<p>Everything you do in Apollo is tracked in a database. If you right click on the gene, and select <strong>Show History</strong>, you have access to the full list of all the actions that were performed on it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/apollo/history.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/apollo/history.png\" alt=\"History of changes on a gene showing many changes to Set Name and a final Set Exon Boundaries change. \" width=\"630\" height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When you click on one of the steps, you can see below the list a preview of how the gene looked at the time. And you can revert to a specific version of the gene by clicking on the arrow button on the right.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adding-more-functional-annotation\">Adding more functional annotation</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes you’ll want to modify a gene that was predicted by FunAnnotate, just to add functional annotation to it, like Gene Ontology terms, of references to external databases (UniProt, InterPro, …). This can be done using Apollo, have a look at the <a href=\"/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/apollo/tutorial.html\">Apollo tutorial for prokaryotes</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"exporting-and-collaborating\">Exporting and collaborating</h1>\n\n<div class=\"Create-your-own-organism\">\n\n  <h2 id=\"exporting-annotation\">Exporting annotation</h2>\n\n  <p>You can continue improving annotation whenever you want, the Apollo server will keep your changes in a safe place for future use.

By using Apollo and JBrowse, you learned how to manually refine predicted annotations<span class=\"Create-your-own-organism\"> and export them to Galaxy for future analyses. You also learn how to give access to your project at any other researcher, making it a real collaborative solution</span><span class=\"Use-a-pre-created-organism\">. Although you use a pre-created organism, remember that you can use Galaxy to add your own organism to Apollo, and give access to your project at any other researcher, making it a real collaborative solution</span>.</p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/apollo/tutorial.html\">similar tutorial for prokaryote genomes</a> exists, using different types of evidence tracks, feel free to have a look at it to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>When refinement is sufficient an updated or new version of the annotation may be exported as GFF3 as well as published as a new JBrowse directory for inspection.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"whats-next\">What’s next?</h1>\n\n<p>After generating your refined annotation, you’ll want to merge it back into the official gene sets.
