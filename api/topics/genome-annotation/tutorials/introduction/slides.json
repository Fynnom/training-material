Structural can come from ab-initio predictions or structural data. Functional annotation often comes from analysis of protein domains or in rare cases from experimental data.\n\n---\n\n## Structural Annotation\n\nTypes of elements:\n\n- genes\n- regulatory regions\n- ncRNA\n- repeat elements\n- pseudogenes and paralogs\n\n---\n\n### Structural Annotation: Why?\n\n![Screenshot of apollo, with genome sequence at the top, and several gene models shown below.
