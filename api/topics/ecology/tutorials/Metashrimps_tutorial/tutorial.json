Having an editable Data Paper draft will allow the producer to complete/modify the draft of Data Paper so that it could become\npublishable as a real Data Paper giving recognition to all the people that helped producing the data.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>What is a Data Paper?</comment-title>\n  <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/data-papers\">GBIF</a> (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), \nA data paper is a peer reviewed document describing a dataset, published in a peer reviewed journal. It takes effort to prepare, curate and describe data. \nData papers provide recognition for this effort using a scholarly article.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"get-data\">Get data</h1>\n\n<blockquote
