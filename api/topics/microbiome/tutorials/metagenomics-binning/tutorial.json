Metagenomics binning is a process used to classify DNA sequences obtained from metagenomic sequencing into discrete groups, or bins, based on their similarity to each other.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of metagenomics binning is to assign the DNA sequences to the organisms or taxonomic groups that they originate from, allowing for a better understanding of the diversity and functions of the microbial communities present in the sample. This is typically achieved through computational methods that include sequence similarity, composition, and other features to group the sequences into bins.</p>\n\n<p>There are several approaches to metagenomics binning, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Sequence composition-based binning</strong>: This method is based on the observation that different genomes have distinct sequence composition patterns, such as GC content or codon usage bias. By analyzing these patterns in metagenomic data, sequence fragments can be assigned to individual genomes or groups of genomes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Coverage-based binning</strong>: This method uses the depth of coverage of sequencing reads to group them into bins. Sequencing reads that originate from the same genome are expected to have similar coverage, and this information can be used to identify groups of reads that represent individual genomes or genome clusters.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Hybrid binning</strong>: This method combines sequence composition-based and coverage-based binning to increase the accuracy of binning results. By using multiple sources of information, hybrid binning can better distinguish closely related genomes that may have similar sequence composition patterns.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Clustering-based binning</strong>: This method groups sequence fragments into clusters based on sequence similarity, and then assigns each cluster to a genome or genome cluster based on its sequence composition and coverage. This method is particularly useful for metagenomic data sets with high levels of genomic diversity.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Supervised machine learning-based binning</strong>: This method uses machine learning algorithms trained on annotated reference genomes to classify metagenomic data into bins. This approach can achieve high accuracy but requires a large number of annotated genomes for training.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of these methods has its strengths and limitations, and the choice of binning method depends on the specific characteristics of the metagenomic data set and the research question being addressed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Metagenomics binning is a complex process that involves many steps and can be challenging due to several problems that can occur during the process</strong>. Some of the most common problems encountered in metagenomics binning include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>High complexity</strong>: Metagenomic samples contain DNA from multiple organisms, which can lead to high complexity in the data.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fragmented sequences</strong>: Metagenomic sequencing often generates fragmented sequences, which can make it difficult to assign reads to the correct bin.</li>\n  <li><strong>Uneven coverage</strong>: Some organisms in a metagenomic sample may be more abundant than others, leading to uneven coverage of different genomes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Incomplete or partial genomes</strong>: Metagenomic sequencing may not capture the entire genome of a given organism, which can make it difficult to accurately bin sequences from that organism.</li>\n  <li><strong>Horizontal gene transfer</strong>: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can complicate metagenomic binning, as it can introduce genetic material from one organism into another.</li>\n  <li><strong>Chimeric sequences</strong>: Sequences that are the result of sequencing errors or contamination can lead to chimeric sequences, which can make it difficult to accurately bin reads.</li>\n  <li><strong>Strain variation</strong>: Organisms within a species can exhibit significant genetic variation, which can make it difficult to distinguish between different strains in a metagenomic sample.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are plenty of computational tools to perform metafenomics binning. Some of the most widely used include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>MaxBin</strong>  (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#maxbin2015\">Wu <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>): A popular de novo binning algorithm that uses a combination of sequence features and marker genes to cluster contigs into genome bins.</li>\n  <li><strong>MetaBAT</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Kang2019\">Kang <i>et al.</i> 2019</a></span>): Another widely used de novo binning algorithm that employs a hierarchical clustering approach based on tetranucleotide frequency and coverage information.</li>\n  <li><strong>CONCOCT</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Alneberg2014\">Alneberg <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>): A de novo binning tool that uses a clustering algorithm based on sequence composition and coverage information to group contigs into genome bins.</li>\n  <li><strong>MyCC</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Lin2016\">Lin and Liao 2016</a></span>): A reference-based binning tool that uses sequence alignment to identify contigs belonging to the same genome or taxonomic group.</li>\n  <li><strong>GroopM</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Imelfort2014\">Imelfort <i>et al.</i> 2014</a></span>): A hybrid binning tool that combines reference-based and de novo approaches to achieve high binning accuracy.</li>\n  <li><strong>MetaWRAP</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Uritskiy2018\">Uritskiy <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span>): A comprehensive metagenomic analysis pipeline that includes various modules for quality control, assembly, binning, and annotation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anvi’o</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Eren2015\">Eren <i>et al.</i> 2015</a></span>): A platform for visualizing and analyzing metagenomic data, including features for binning, annotation, and comparative genomics.</li>\n  <li><strong>SemiBin</strong> (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Pan2022\">Pan <i>et al.</i> 2022</a></span>): A command tool for metagenomic binning with deep learning, handles both short and long reads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A benchmark study of metagenomics software can be found at <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#Sczyrba2017\">Sczyrba <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>.

In order to do that, we will use data from the study: <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00005630#overview\">Temporal shotgun metagenomic dissection of the coffee fermentation ecosystem</a> and MetaBAT 2 algorithm. MetaBAT is a popular software tool for metagenomics binning, and there are several reasons why it is often used:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>High accuracy</em>: MetaBAT uses a combination of tetranucleotide frequency, coverage depth, and read linkage information to bin contigs, which has been shown to be highly accurate and efficient.</li>\n  <li><em>Easy to use</em>: MetaBAT has a user-friendly interface and can be run on a standard desktop computer, making it accessible to a wide range of researchers with varying levels of computational expertise.</li>\n  <li><em>Flexibility</em>: MetaBAT can be used with a variety of sequencing technologies, including Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore, and can be applied to both microbial and viral metagenomes.</li>\n  <li><em>Scalability</em>: MetaBAT can handle large-scale datasets, and its performance has been shown to improve with increasing sequencing depth.</li>\n  <li><em>Compatibility</em>: MetaBAT outputs MAGs in standard formats that can be easily integrated into downstream analyses and tools, such as taxonomic annotation and functional prediction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For an in-depth analysis of the structure and functions of the coffee microbiome, a temporal shotgun metagenomic study (six time points) was performed. The six samples have been sequenced with Illumina MiSeq utilizing whole genome sequencing.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the 6 original dataset of the coffee fermentation system, we generated mock datasets for this tutorial.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\">\n  <agenda-title></agenda-title>\n\n  <p>In this tutorial, we will cover:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n  <li><a href=\"#prepare-analysis-history-and-data\" id=\"markdown-toc-prepare-analysis-history-and-data\">Prepare analysis history and data</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#binning\" id=\"markdown-toc-binning\">Binning</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#de-replication\" id=\"markdown-toc-de-replication\">De-replication</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#checking-the-quality-of-the-bins\" id=\"markdown-toc-checking-the-quality-of-the-bins\">Checking the quality of the bins</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#conclusions\" id=\"markdown-toc-conclusions\">Conclusions</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"prepare-analysis-history-and-data\">Prepare analysis history and data</h1>\n\n<p>MetaBAT 2 takes metagenomic sequencing data as input, typically in the form of assembled contigs in fasta format and coverage information in bam format. Specifically, MetaBAT 2 requires two input files:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>A fasta file containing the assembled contigs, which can be generated from raw metagenomic sequencing reads using an assembler such as MEGAHIT, SPAdes, or IDBA-UD.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>A bam file containing the read coverage information for each contig, which can be generated from the same sequencing reads using mapping software such as Bowtie2 or BWA.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>MetaBAT 2 also requires a configuration file specifying various parameters and options for the binning process, such as the minimum contig length, the maximum number of clusters to generate, and the maximum expected contamination level.</p>\n\n<p>To run binning, we first need to get the data into Galaxy. Any analysis should get its own Galaxy history.

Here we developed automated metagenome binning software, called MetaBAT, which integrates empirical probabilistic distances of genome abundance and tetranucleotide frequency. On synthetic datasets MetaBAT on average achieves 98percent precision and 90% recall at the strain level with 281 near complete unique genomes. Applying MetaBAT to a human gut microbiome data set we recovered 176 genome bins with 92% precision and 80% recall. Further analyses suggest MetaBAT is able to recover genome fragments missed in reference genomes up to 19%, while 53 genome bins are novel. In summary, we believe MetaBAT is a powerful tool to facilitate comprehensive understanding of complex microbial communities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We will use the uploaded assembled fasta files as

removing all but the “best” genome from each redundant set. How similar genomes need to be to be considered “same”, how to determine which genome is “best”, and other important decisions are discussed in <a href=\"https://drep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/choosing_parameters.html\">Important Concepts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A common use for genome de-replication is the case of individual assembly of metagenomic data. If metagenomic samples are collected in a series, a common way to assemble the short reads is with a “co-assembly”. That is, combining the reads from all samples and assembling them together. The problem with this is assembling similar strains together can severely fragment assemblies, precluding recovery of a good genome bin. An alternative option is to assemble each sample separately, and then “de-replicate” the bins from each assembly to make a final genome set.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-2\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./individual-assembly.png\" alt=\"Image shows the process of individual assembly on two strains and five samples, after individual assembly of samples two samples are chosen for de-replication process.

Instead, MetaBAT 2 focuses on improving the accuracy of binning by leveraging various features such as read coverage, differential coverage across samples, and sequence composition. It aims to distinguish between different genomes present in the metagenomic dataset and assign contigs to the appropriate bins.</p>\n\n<p>Several tools have been designed for the proccess of de-replication. <strong><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code></strong> is a software tool designed for the dereplication of genomes in metagenomic datasets. The goal is to retain a representative set of genomes to improve downstream analyses, such as taxonomic profiling and functional annotation.</p>\n\n<p>An typical workflow of how <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code> works for dereplication in metagenomics includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Genome Comparison</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code> uses a pairwise genome comparison approach to assess the similarity between genomes in a given metagenomic dataset.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Clustering</em>: Based on the genome similarities, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code> performs clustering to group similar genomes into “genome clusters.” Each cluster represents a group of closely related genomes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Genome Quality Assessment</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code> evaluates the quality of each genome within a cluster.

This representative genome is considered as the “dereplicated” version of the cluster.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Dereplication Output</em>: The output of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">dRep</code> includes information about the dereplicated genomes, including their identity, completeness, and contamination.

CheckM is a software tool used in metagenomics binning to assess the completeness and contamination of genome bins. Metagenomics binning is the process of separating DNA fragments from a mixed community of microorganisms into individual bins, each representing a distinct genome.</p>\n\n<p>CheckM compares the genome bins to a set of universal single-copy marker genes that are present in nearly all bacterial and archaeal genomes. By identifying the presence or absence of these marker genes in the bins, CheckM can estimate the completeness of each genome bin (i.e., the percentage of the total set of universal single-copy marker genes that are present in the bin) and the degree of contamination (i.e., the percentage of marker genes that are found in more than one bin).</p>\n\n<p>This information can be used to evaluate the quality of genome bins and to select high-quality bins for further analysis, such as genome annotation and comparative genomics. CheckM is widely used in metagenomics research and has been shown to be an effective tool for assessing the quality of genome bins. Some of the key functionalities of CheckM are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Estimation of genome completeness</em>: CheckM uses a set of universal single-copy marker genes to estimate the completeness of genome bins. The completeness score indicates the proportion of these marker genes that are present in the bin, providing an estimate of how much of the genome has been recovered.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Estimation of genome contamination</em>: CheckM uses the same set of marker genes to estimate the degree of contamination in genome bins. The contamination score indicates the proportion of marker genes that are present in multiple bins, suggesting that the genome bin may contain DNA from more than one organism.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Identification of potential misassemblies</em>: CheckM can identify potential misassemblies in genome bins based on the distribution of marker genes across the genome.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Visualization of results</em>: CheckM can generate various plots and tables to visualize the completeness, contamination, and other quality metrics for genome bins, making it easier to interpret the results.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Taxonomic classification</em>: CheckM can also be used to classify genome bins taxonomically based on the presence of specific marker genes associated with different taxonomic groups.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on the previous analysis we will use <strong>CheckM lineage_wf</strong>: <em>Assessing the completeness and contamination of genome bins using lineage-specific marker sets</em></p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">CheckM lineage_wf</code> is a specific workflow within the CheckM software tool that is used for taxonomic classification of genome bins based on their marker gene content.

In the figure above we see that after individual assembly we have results for every individual assembly represented with pie charts. Different colours on these charts show different strains (organisms). Every chart has a different percentage of every strain which means that the assemblies contain different strains in different proportions in each sample.\n\nAfterwards, we do the process of de-replication. We try to combine all the assemblies and try to identify which genomes are the most proper.\n\nIndividual assembly is a good practice as well as co-assembly. They both have pros and cons and that are just different techniques.\n\nCo-assembly is a more common practice. But in case of co-assembly the genome might be more fragmented afterwards (like it is shown in the figure)  and sometimes it can be less proper. However, it should be decided in every single case which approach to use (co- or individual).

By comparing the outcomes of several binning techniques, researchers can increase the precision and accuracy of genome binning.</p>\n\n<p>There are various binning methods available for metagenomic data, including reference-based, clustering-based, hybrid approaches, and machine learning. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, and the selection of the appropriate method depends on the research question and the characteristics of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing the outcomes of multiple binning methods can help to identify the most accurate and reliable method for a specific study. This can be done by evaluating the quality of the resulting bins in terms of completeness, contamination, and strain heterogeneity, as well as by comparing the composition and functional profiles of the identified genomes.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, by carefully selecting and comparing binning methods, researchers can improve the quality and reliability of genome bins, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of the functional and ecological roles of microbial communities in various environments.</p>\n"],"ref_slides":[],"hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-03-14 14:57:42 +0000","pub_date":"2023-12-05 14:37:36 +0000","version":4,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/microbiome/tutorials/metagenomics-binning/tutorial.json","tools":["toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/checkm_lineage_wf/checkm_lineage_wf/1.2.0+galaxy0","toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/megahit/megahit/1.2.9+galaxy0"],"supported_servers":{"exact":[{"url":"https://galaxytrakr.org/","name":"GalaxyTrakr","usegalaxy":false},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.cz/","name":"UseGalaxy.cz","usegalaxy":false},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","name":"UseGalaxy.eu","usegalaxy":true},{"url":"https://usegalaxy.fr/","name":"UseGalaxy.fr","usegalaxy":false}],"inexact":[]},"topic_name_human":"Microbiome","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[{"name":"checkm_lineage_wf","owner":"iuc","revisions":"f0107b9f2dc3","tool_panel_section_label":"Metagenomic Analysis","tool_shed_url":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"},{"name":"megahit","owner":"iuc","revisions":"14ddfc8ffb93","tool_panel_section_label":"Assembly","tool_shed_url":"https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"}]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools:\n- name: checkm_lineage_wf\n  owner: iuc\n  revisions: f0107b9f2dc3\n  tool_panel_section_label: Metagenomic Analysis\n  tool_shed_url: https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/\n- name: megahit\n  owner: iuc\n  revisions: 14ddfc8ffb93\n  tool_panel_section_label: Assembly\n  tool_shed_url: https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","contributors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Pechlivanis","email":"npechlv@gmail.com","twitter":"npechl","joined":"2023-05","orcid":"0000-0003-2502-612X","id":"npechl","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/npechl.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/npechl/"},{"name":"Fotis E.
