It is more complex, but you get full details (functional information) about the picture on each puzzle.\n\n- amplicon: we only look at the corner pieces, these are easy to spot, and all puzzles have them. It will not tell us all the details (e.g. functional information) of the picture on the puzzle, but might be enough to tell us whether it is a landscape or a portrait or abstract art for instance (taxonomy).\n\n---\n\n## Amplicon\n\n\n- Targetted approach, e.g. 16S (bacteria), 18S (eukaryotes), ITS (fungi)\n- Amplify gene of specific taxonomic group, i.e. not host or environment\n\n![left is picture of e. coli ribosome with \"so much rna\" written, right is the RNA structure in a diagram](../../images/16S_gene.png)\n\n---\n\n## Amplicon\n\n- Highly conserved gene: easy to target across all bacteria\n- With variable regions: distinguish between genus\n\n![line graph showing V regions as peaks along x axis of alignment position, and y index of shannon-index/alignment-index.](../../images/16S_variableregions.jpg)\n\n???\nV1, V2 etc are the variable regions\n\n---\n\n## Amplicon\n\n- Pros\n  - Well-established\n  - Inexpensive ($50-$100/sample)\n- Cons\n - V-region choice can bias results\n - Is based on a very well conserved gene, making it hard to resolve species and strains\n\n\n???\n18S gene also amplifies archaea\n\n---\n\n## Shotgun metagenomics\n\n- Aims to sequence the \"whole\" metagenome\n\n- Pros:\n  - Not biased by amplicon primer set\n  - Not limited by conservation of the amplicon\n  - Can also provide functional information\n\n- Cons:\n  - Environmental contamination, including host\n  - More expensive ($1000+/sample)\n  - Complex data analysis\n    - Requires high performance computing, high memory, high compute capacity\n\n---\n\n\n## End-to-End\n\n![graphi with an arrow going from sampling (nose picture) to extraction to amplification to ngs to bioinformatics (computer picture)](../../images/16S_end-to-end.png)\n\nEvery step in this process can have serious impact on the results\n\n---\n\n## Bioinformatics\n\n![cartoon titled drowned in NGS data with a man covered in messy data.](../../images/so_much_data.png)\n\n```\nRoche 454 GS:    ~ 100.000 reads\nIllumina MiSeq:  ~ 25.000.000 reads\nShotgun:             ~ ?
