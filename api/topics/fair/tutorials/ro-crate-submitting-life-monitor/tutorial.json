Like all software, even the best\nworkflows can break over time if left unmaintained: for instance, there could be\na regression or an API change in an unpinned dependency, or an external resource\nthat the workflow relies upon might be moved to a different URL. Periodic\nautomated <strong>testing</strong> is a fundamental practice that helps expose such problems,\ngiving workflow maintainers a chance to intervene and fix them.  The\n<a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/\">LifeMonitor</a> helps you monitor and periodically\nexecute the automated tests for your workflow.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, workflows should be findable to be reusable.\n<a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/\">LifeMonitor</a> helps automate the generation of\n<a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/workflow_testing_ro_crate\">RO-Crate metadata</a> as\nwell as registering new releases of your workflow with the\n<a href=\"https://workflowhub.eu\">WorkflowHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/\">LifeMonitor</a> can apply automated checks\nto your workflow repository to help you follow <a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html\">community best\npractices</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pre-conditions\">Pre-conditions</h2>\n\n<p>We assume you <strong>published a Galaxy workflow</strong> to a GitHub repository following the\n<a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html#community-best-practices\"><em>Galaxy Community best\npractices</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, we assume you have followed the same best practices to <a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html#generating-tests-for-your-workflow\"><strong>create\ntests</strong> for your\nworkflow</a> using\n<a href=\"https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices_workflows.html#tests\">Planemo</a>,\nas well as configuring a <a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html#adding-a-github-workflow\">GitHub Actions\nworkflow</a> to automatically\nrun those tests.  Don’t worry if this sounds like a lot: the <a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html\">best\npractices</a> document provides straightforward\ninstructions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"running-example\">Running example</h3>\n\n<p>As a running example, we’re going to use a simple “sort and change case”\nworkflow: it merely takes a text file, sorts the lines and swaps the case of all\nthe letters.

The app can do\nthe following things.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Examine your repository and apply a series of automated <em>checks</em>.</li>\n  <li>Suggest pull requests (PRs) to make changes or additions to bring the workflow\nrepository closer to conforming to best practices.</li>\n  <li>Open issues to let you know about problems detected by the checks:\n    <ul>\n      <li>in some cases, you can interact with the LifeMonitor bot through the issues,\n  to provide information or issue commands.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Register new releases/versions of the workflow with both the <a href=\"https://app.lifemonitor.eu/\">LifeMonitor\nservice</a> (for test monitoring) and the\n<a href=\"https://workflowhub.eu/\">WorkflowHub</a> workflow registry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Follow the instructions provided by the <a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/lm_wft_best_practices_github_app#installation\">LifeMonitor\ndocumentation</a>\nto complete the app installation on your repository, and:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>we recommend that you enable the LifeMonitor “Issue Checks”;</li>\n  <li>we also recommend that you enable the automatic upload to the\n  <a href=\"https://workflowhub.eu/\">WorkflowHub</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>Accounts Required</tip-title>\n  <p>Note that completing the installation steps may require you to create an\naccount with both LifeMonitor and WorkflowHub.\nWe recommend <strong>using <a href=\"https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login/\">LS Login</a></strong> to authenticate with both\nservices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>GitHub Connection Required</tip-title>\n  <p>You will also need to connect your GitHub account to your LifeMonitor account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"configure-your-lifemonitor-account\">Configure your LifeMonitor account</h2>\n\n<p>To fully enable the features provided by LifeMonitor you need to enable some\noptional settings in the LM configuration.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enable-e-mail-notifications\">Enable e-mail notifications</h3>\n\n<p>LifeMonitor can send you emails to notify you of important events related to\nyour workflows or the workflows you’ve <a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/lm_dashboard#subscribing-to-workflows\">subscribed\nto</a>.  We\nrecommend performing this step to – among other things – receive notifications\nif your workflow tests start failing, or when a release of your workflow has\nbeen registered with the LifeMonitor test monitoring service and with the\nWorkflowHub registry.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/lm_test_monitoring#enabling-e-mail-notifications\">Click\nhere</a>\nto access the LifeMonitor documentation on how to perform this step.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"configure-github-integration\">Configure GitHub integration</h3>\n\n<p>If you <a href=\"#installing-the-lm-github-app\">installed the LM GitHub App</a> on your\nworkflow repository your GitHub account should already be connected to\nLifeMonitor. Verify this by accessing your account’s <a href=\"https://app.lifemonitor.eu/account/profile\">profile\npage</a> and checking that the\n<strong>Connected Accounts</strong> table includes an entry for GitHub and it says\n<strong>CONNECTED</strong>; if it says “CONNECT”, then click on the button and follow the\nprocedure.  See the <a href=\"https://www.lifemonitor.eu/faq#which-external-accounts-are-linked-with-my-lifemonitor-account\">LifeMonitor\ndocumentation</a>\nfor more details.</p>\n\n<p>If you want, you can now check the LifeMonitor <a href=\"https://app.lifemonitor.eu/account/profile?currentView=githubSettingsTab\">GitHub integration\nsettings</a>\nfor your account.

The checks generally report one problem at a time, by opening an issue\nor opening a PR with a suggested fix.  In the following subsections we’ll show\nthe sequence of PR’s and issues that are opened in our Sort and Change Case\nworkflow repository.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ro-crate-metadata\">RO-Crate metadata</h3>\n\n<p>LM might notice that we don’t have an RO-Crate:\n<a href=\"./images/missing_ro_crate_pr.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"./images/missing_ro_crate_pr.png\" alt=\"Missing RO-Crate PR. \" width=\"790\" height=\"594\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The LM app <strong>automatically</strong> executes\n<a href=\"https://github.com/crs4/repo2rocrate\">repo2crate</a> as recommended by <a href=\"/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-galaxy-best-practices/tutorial.html#best-practice-repositories-and-ro-crate\">best\npractices</a> and\nopens a pull request to propose the resulting RO-Crate for integration in our\nrepository.  Review the RO-Crate and integrate additional metadata or correct\nit as necessary. Finally, merge the changes into your repository.
