Principles relating to data identifiers are highlighted in <strong>black</strong>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"using-persistent-identifiers-pids\">Using persistent identifiers (PIDs)</h1>\n\n<p>Identifiers are an important theme within the FAIR principles, arguably being foundational; they are considered two of the pillars for the FAIR principles since they are crucial for Findable (F) and Accessible (A) principles.</p>\n\n<p>Identifiers are an eternal reference to a digital resource such as a dataset and its metadata. They provide the information required to reliably identify, verify and locate your research data.</p>\n\n<p>Commonly, a persistent identifier is a unique record ID in a database, or a unique URL that takes a researcher to the data in question in a database. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) have to be unique so that only one dataset can be identified by this identifier. In addition to the identifier being unique, it needs to be persistent. When depositing or hosting data, you should ensure the longevity of this persistence meets your requirements, which may require reading specific database policies regarding identifier policy.</p>\n\n<p>Since FAIR permits the withdrawal of data, the FAIR Principles combat the potential for broken URLs by stating:  <em>“Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available.”</em>  (FAIR Principle A2).  This means the link (PID) remains valid, displaying all the original metadata of the record even though the data is no longer available.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It is important to note that when you upload your data to a public repository, the repository will create this ID for you automatically</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on <a href=\"https://howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/persistent-identifiers/\">how to FAIR</a>, many resources can help you find databases to assign PIDs to your data. One of these resources is <a href=\"https://fairsharing.org/\">FAIRsharing</a> something we’ve already encountered in the previous episodes. <a href=\"https://fairsharing.org/\">FAIRsharing</a>, provides a list of databases grouped by domains and organisations.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-structure-of-persistent-identifiers\">The structure of persistent identifiers</h1>\n\n<p>To ensure that a PID is globally unique, commonly it is supplied as a unique URL. For the case of a record in a biological database, the use of a URL ensures that the database record ID is associated with the database name or often some derivation of this. This is often enough to ensure the uniqueness of the PID for any future scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Commonly, for things like publications, a DOI is used for the PID, where DOI stands for Digital Object Identifier. An example is shown below where the PID is constructed from 3 pieces of information: the resolver service, the prefix (namespace) and the suffix (dataset ID).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resolver service</strong>: the domain/service/institution hosting the PID e.g. [https://www.doi.org] (doi.org)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prefix</strong>: a unique number referring to the publisher. This is also known as the namespace.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suffix</strong>: the unique dataset number</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/figure5-1.png\" alt=\"DOI_structure. \" width=\"818\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../images/figure5-1.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> The structure of a DOI</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>For biological data, PIDs usually require a resolver that can deal with multiple resolving locations, which means that if a database changes its name or internal structure, the new and old variations of the PID remain valid and take the user to the (meta)data.  One commonly used resolver service is called <a href=\"https://docs.identifiers.org/\">identifiers.org</a> which maintains a list of database namespaces (prefix’s) as a persistent record.  If a database changes its name, it keeps the original namespace operational or alternatively arranges for redirection from the original.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of using identifiers.org to construct a PID are given below for 2 different databases, <a href=\"https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Gene/Summary?g=ENSMUSG00000031887;r=8:105984918-105991241\">Ensembl</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/pathways/WP1243.html\">WikiPathways</a>, respectively. The <strong>namespace</strong> is given as the database name in these examples.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-2\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/figure5-2.png\" alt=\"PID_structure. \" width=\"818\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../images/figure5-2.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 2</strong>:</span> The structure of a PID using the identifiers.org resolver service</figcaption></figure>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title></question-title>\n\n  <p>Access the preprint for <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1101/117812&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1681921501619473&amp;usg=AOvVaw0iHyEgvEzDniMbIcvhokQk\">Identifiers for the 21st century: How to design, provision, and reuse persistent identifiers to maximize utility and impact of life science data</a>.
