Other repositories for raw sequence data exist (e.g. SRA, ENA, DDBJ), but ArrayExpress and GEO specifically house and index expression data , including rich metadata detailing samples, data processing and final results files such as gene expression matrices.</p>\n\n<p>By submitting data to a public repository, it becomes openly accessible, searchable and annotated with rich metadata, by the submitter and curation team.

In its simplest form, an ontology is a dictionary of terms you use to annotate a piece of data. For example, the NCBI taxonomy database is something you may have used to annotate species within a dataset. An ontology, though, will also define relationships between terms. So in the taxonomy example, the term “Homo sapiens” will belong to parent terms such as Primate, Mammal and so on. Importantly, by using an ontology you can ensure you are using interoperable and searchable terms with your data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"i2-metadata-use-vocabularies-that-follow-fair-principles--r1-metadata-are-richly-described-with-a-plurality-of-accurate-and-relevant-attributes\">(I2) (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.

Although, if you wish to start using ontologies to annotate your data at the point it is produced, the <a href=\"https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard\">FAIRsharing Standards registry</a> is a place to start. Importantly, when an ontology is published it too becomes findable and reusable in the context of the FAIR principles <strong>(I2)</strong>.\nMetadata using published ontologies permit interoperability since you can match identical annotations across data and databases <strong>(I1 &amp; I2)</strong>.
