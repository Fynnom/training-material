Principles relating to data registration in <strong>black</strong>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"what-is-data-deposition-and-registration\">What is data deposition and registration?</h1>\n\n<p>Data deposition and registration refer to the process of uploading data to a searchable resource and providing appropriate metadata to facilitate its discoverability.\nFor example, a data repository, where data and metadata can be uploaded, may enable it to be discovered, preserved and accessed.  Here we use the general term data repository to describe any online storage location that can host deposited (meta)data.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of FAIR, data deposition relates to a number of the Guiding Principles. Firstly,  <em>“(meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource, Indexed in a searchable resource: a resource where (meta)data are organised so that they can be queried based on defined fields, ”</em> (FAIR Principle F4).  Searchable (indexed) metadata enables humans and computers to query and discover data of interest, though this depends on what is indexed.  Here, indexing refers to a process that occurs within the architecture of the data repository (local indexing) where metadata are organised so that they can be queried based on a defined field.  It is worth noting that community resources focused on a particular domain (for example, the human database in <a href=\"https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index\">Ensembl</a>) are better indexed for a particular community, rather than generic repositories (for example, <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>) which may not index the community specific components, and may focus on higher level metadata.  Indexing by an internet search engine is another example of this.  Google (and other search engines, such as Yahoo and Yandex) have an agreed vocabulary (<a href=\"https://schema.org/\">schema.org</a>), within web pages, that are ‘scraped’ and indexed.  While the focus of this vocabulary was originally intended for commercial products, community-specific efforts to facilitate discipline-specific indexing are underway (for example, <a href=\"https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/findability/seo/bioschemas-data-page.html\">Bioschemas</a>).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"why-should-i-upload-my-data-to-a-data-repository\">Why should I upload my data to a data repository?</h1>\n\n<p>Data repositories are generally preferred to file storage systems (such as Dropbox) or sharing data on an ad hoc basis since they often better support FAIR best practice.  Repositories will assign citable, <em>“globally unique and persistent identifiers”</em> (FAIR Principle F1) to data, and in some cases enable a data submitter to apply a data usage licence through association with the resource (FAIR Principle R1.1).</p>\n\n<p>Although not exclusively, data repositories support the creation of metadata through curation interfaces providing drop-downs and text fields for metadata entry and validation.  Often in the case of a domain or data-specific data repository, such as BioStudies shown in the previous Episode, drop-downs for metadata curation will link community-endorsed vocabularies (FAIR Principle R1.3).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"types-of-data-repository\">Types of data repository</h1>\n\n<p>General public data repositories, such as <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>, are multidisciplinary and permit registration and upload of open and closed access (meta)data.  Metadata curation is relatively high level and made searchable via indexing.  Relating to data in the Life Sciences, Zenodo is often used to publish and provide citable URLs to supplementary data within articles, usually in instances where a domain repository does not exist.</p>\n\n<p>Institutional repositories work similarly and provide an online archive for hosting, indexing and preserving research output specific to an institution.  Typically these house more than data, providing a repository often for documents and articles.  Institutions will have their own systems supported locally or buy into company solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Discipline-specific repositories cater for communities and datatypes, and typically provide web interfaces to annotate rich metadata at the point when data are submitted.  Examples of these belong to the suite of data repositories at the <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/\">European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)</a> where rich metadata creation is supported by teams of curators.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title></question-title>\n\n  <p>An example of a discipline-specific repository is <a href=\"https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress\">ArrayExpress</a> database.
