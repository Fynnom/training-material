The following exercise dips into this report and asks you to investigate some of FAIR’s history and foundation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"open-data-and-fair\">Open data and FAIR</h2>\n<p>The level of accessibility and usability criteria distinguish open from FAIR data. Open data is accessible without limitations, whereas FAIR data specifies certain requirements for access and use.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"../../images/fair_open.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/fair_open.png\" alt=\"text reading fair does not equal open. \" width=\"1836\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Open data can be modified, and distributed for any reason. Although extensively used and accessible, FAIR data additionally includes the following usability standards that go beyond permission alone:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>In order to be found and cited, FAIR data must be identified and deposited into online public records.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>It is necessary to make FAIR data available so that it may be accessed, read, and processed.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>FAIR data needs to be captured and presented in a form that can be used.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The published FAIR Guiding Principles: Wilkinson, M., Dumontier, M., Aalbersberg, I. et al.

In other words, FAIRness refers to how FAIR your data is to a certain level and indicates a tacit method of evaluating its compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation and frameworks for data FAIRification. Each of the 15 FAIR principles is put into context with real data examples: <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">GO FAIR</a>, <a href=\"https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html\">FAIR Cookbook</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>The FAIR Principles place a strong focus on encouraging individual data reuse while also supporting the capacity of machines to automatically discover and utilise the data.
