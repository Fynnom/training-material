Introduction</h1>\n<p>DNA sequencing has become one of the key technologies in molecular biology, with applications in diagnostics, evolutionary biology, drug discovery, forensics and much more. Drop in sequencing costs and breakthroughs in sequencing technologies has seen increasing utilization of sequencing as a research tool, featuring in thousands of life-science publications every year.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to publication many journals and funders require authors to submit their raw sequence data to one of the three INSDC member databases – <strong>ENA, NCBI or DDBJ</strong> – between which data is synchronised on a daily basis. INSDC is the core infrastructure for sharing nucleotide sequence data and metadata in the public domain. Data in INSDC member databases is available permanently, for free and with unrestricted access. For each submitted sequence a unique accession number is issued which can be reported in the publication.</p>\n\n<p>The three databases have different methods for making submissions. If your database of choice is ENA and you \nneed to submit data stored on a remote server, you are in the right place. This tutorial will cover how to find your way around the ENA Webin portal for uploading raw sequencing read data as well as accompanying metadata, and use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL\">cURL</a> to copy read files over to ENA’s FTP server.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to use Galaxy tools for submission to ENA you may find <a href=\"/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/upload-data-to-ena/tutorial.html\">Submitting sequence data to ENA</a> tutorial helpful.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"tip\">\n  <tip-title>What is cURL?</tip-title>\n  <p>cURL is a command-line tool and library for transferring data over the internet. It allows you to send and receive data from various protocols like HTTP, FTP, and more. In simple terms, it’s a tool that helps your computer talk to other computers on the internet and fetch or send information, like downloading files from a website or making API requests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"ena-submission-routes\">ENA Submission Routes</h2>\n\n<p>There are three routes via which one can submit data to ENA.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The Webin Interactive portal allows you to submit data by filling out forms on your browser. This is what we will cover in this tutorial,</li>\n  <li>Webin-command-line interface (CLI), which allows submissions through a terminal, and</li>\n  <li>Programmatic submission, which requires the submissions to be prepared as XML documents and then uploaded using cURL or Webin portal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Table 1.</strong> ENA submission routes</p>\n<blockquote class=\"matrix\">\n  <table>\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th> </th>\n        <th>Interactive</th>\n        <th>Webin-CLI</th>\n        <th>Programmatic</th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Study</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Sample</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Read data</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Genome Assembly</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Transcriptome Assembly</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Template Sequence</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>Other Analyses</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>N</td>\n        <td>Y</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see from the Table 1, you can submit some data types only through a certain route. However, read data can be submitted via all three routes.</p>\n\n<p>To begin with the submission process you will need to have a Webin submission account. You can register an account free of cost through the Webin portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/webin/login).</p>\n\n<p>For data submission, ENA provides a detailed guide (https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide.html), which I recommend you consult for questions specific to your user case. Remember that ENA frequently changes its submission protocols, so you should check the ENA guide for updates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ena-metadata-model\">ENA Metadata Model</h2>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/metadata_model.png\" alt=\"ENA metadata model. \" width=\"1212\" height=\"610\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/metadata_model.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> ENA metadata model</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>The ENA metadata model (Figure 1) represents how metadata for a submission is structured and linked. Different information pertaining to a submission is organised into objects within the metadata model. Therefore, understanding the metadata model will enable you to determine which objects you need to submit.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-study\">1. Study</h3>\n<p>All submissions require the study object. This object defines study accession, ownership, affiliation and release date. It also binds together all related objects into one cohesive project.</p>\n\n<p>Study object submission generates a BioProject accession (PRJEB<em>) which can be used for citing data submitted to ENA, and a study accession (ERP</em>).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-sample\">2. Sample</h3>\n<p>Sample object defines metadata about the sequenced biomaterial, e.g. bacteria, virus, etc. One sample should represent one sequencing library.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure that each sample is registered with sufficient metadata so as to provide enough context for the data to be easily interpreted, a mandatory, recommended and optional set of attributes should be provided for a sample.  Sample checklists have been developed in collaboration with different research communities to ensure that they are relevant and realistic for their context. They differ with the nature of the sample.</p>\n\n<p>A registered sample will receive a BioSample accession (SAMEA<em>) and ENA sample accession (ERS</em>).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-raw-reads\">3. Raw reads</h3>\n<p>Metadata for raw reads is represented in ‘experiment’ and ‘run’ objects, where ‘experiment’ holds metadata on the sequencing method and ‘run’ holds metadata about the read files and their location on an FTP server.</p>\n\n<p>Each read file submission will receive a run accession (ERR<em>) and an Experiment accession (ERX</em>).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"02-submitting-data\">02.

Read metadata</h2>\n<h3 id=\"metadata-preparation-2\">Metadata preparation</h3>\n<p>Having registered the sample, we can now add information about sequence reads generated from them.
