Various insets zoom in from the DNase I hypersensitive sites to DNA with transcription factors and binding sites, which zooms into a block diagram of a gene.](../../images/ecker_2012.jpg)\n<small>\n[*Ecker et al, Nature, 2012*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955614)\n</small>\n\n---\n\n### Chromatin immuno-precipitation\n\n![Cartoon of Chromatin immuno-precipitation. DNA interacts with proteins, this is cross-linked and sheared into DNA-protein complexes, immunoprecipitated, purified, and the bound DNA is sequenced. This is then mapped to a reference genome and the tag distribution is plotted along a chromosome.](../../images/szalkowski_schmid_2011.jpg)\n\n[*Szalkowski & Schmid, Brief Bioinform, 2011*](https://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/6/626.long)\n\n---\n\n## How to analyze ChIP-seq data?\n\n---\n\n### Common procedures for ChIP-seq data analysis\n\n![Complex graphic with the first step being Sequence alignment.

Lastly is peak calling, for broad peaks CCAT and SICER, for Sharp peaks MACS, and for both ZINBA.](../../images/kidder_2011.jpg)\n\n[*Kidder et al, Nature Immunology, 2011*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3541830/)\n"],"hands_on":false,"slides":true,"mod_date":"2024-03-05 13:15:24 +0000","pub_date":"2017-06-12 08:10:40 +0000","version":3,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/epigenetics/tutorials/introduction-chip-seq/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Epigenetics","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial"}
