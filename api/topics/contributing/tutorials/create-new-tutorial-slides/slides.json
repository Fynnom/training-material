E.g.:\n  - Motivation why X is useful\n  - Concepts needed to get most out of tutorial\n- Examples relevant to audience\n  - Avoid: \"here is a feature to add link type tracks\"\n  - Try for: \"If you want to visualise SVs in cancer, ... this link type tracks are useful\"\n  - Try for: Using examples from existing papers\n\n???\n\n- If your slides are attached to a tutorial, then they can be a good place to provide learners with motivation for the tutorial.\n- If you can provide examples that are relevant to your audience, this will encourage them to follow the tutorial.\n- Try to avoid dry text and links to external resources whenever possible, those can be best in the tutorial which a learner would read at their own pace, rather than slides which are presented at the presenter's pace.\n\n---\n\n\n## Formatting: Basic\n\n.pull-left[\n<span style=\"font-size: 35px;font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';font-weight: normal;text-align: center;\">Slide Title</span>\n\nA list\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\nand numbered list\n\n1.
