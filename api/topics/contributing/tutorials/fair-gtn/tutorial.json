It provides a record of training content development and ensure materials curation via  cross-domain repositories (i.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a>). Keeping your materials in the right places from the beginning will make it possible for you to more effectively and widely distribute your work without any duplication in contribution. Instruction where to start creating a new tutorial can be found at <a href=\"/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial/tutorial.html\">GTN contributing tutorial</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"improve-findability-of-your-training-materials-by-properly-describing-them\">Improve findability of your training materials by properly describing them</h2>\n\n<p>Describing your training materials with structured metadata is fundamental to making them FAIR resource. Creating metadata boost findability and preserve information and can be updated after publication. GTN  tutorial require several mandatory metadata information such as learning objectives following Bloom’s taxonomy <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#chevron2014metacognitive\">Chevron 2014</a></span>, prerequisites, time estimate, or questions addressed by the tutorial. Content developers needs to know where to find all of the available metadata to reference it later. <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a> is a collaborative project with a mission to create the addition of structured metadata to web pages. It describes data using shared vocabulary. It is in this spirit that the <a href=\"https://bioschemas.org/\">BioSchemas</a> community initiative was created to extend the Schema.org standard to life-science resources with training content specification. GTN offers schemas command line <a href=\"/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/schemas/tutorial.html\">tutorial</a> where metadata can be added or updated. This reduces the complexity of keywords and set the scene for controlled vocabularies environment. This increases the effectiveness of metadata filtering, which decreases ambiguity and makes it easier to find and retrieve information.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"give-your-training-materials-a-unique-identity\">Give your training materials a unique identity</h2>\n\n<p>To support teachers and trainers, the GTN tutorials rely on specific tags and identifiers. Adding persistent identifiers (PIDs) to training materials makes them easy to cite and aids citation counting in research metric systems <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#mcmurry2017identifiers\">McMurry <i>et al.</i> 2017</a></span>. Providing PIDs ensure that tag/identifier will continue to work even if webpage location changes. Data used for tutorials are required to be stored at <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/\">Zenodo</a> and associated with <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/\">Digital Object Identifiers</a> (DOI).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"register-your-training-materials-online\">Register your training materials online</h2>\n<p>Sharing and publishing with the GTN training helps minimize the amount of time and effort required for instructors to prepare for and run their training courses and workshops, by providing templates and a complete training infrastructure. Online registry makes your content more discoverable and accessible to wider community. GTN tutorials are automatically registered on <a href=\"https://tess.elixir-europe.org/\">TeSS</a> (ELIXIR Training e-support system).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"define-access-rules-for-your-training-materials\">Define access rules for your training materials</h2>\n<p>The GTN materials are designed to be flexible in their use, open access and community-driven. It is important to follow the hosting website disclaimers and keep materials metadata in place.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"use-an-interoperable-format-for-your-training-materials\">Use an interoperable format for your training materials</h2>\n<p>GTN Tutorials aim to follow best practices in course design, so that they can be used in different environments. Content of the tutorials and slides are written in <a href=\"/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial-content/tutorial.html\">Markdown</a> and supported by templates. Metadata are stored in YAML and workflows in JSON. Self-contained structure allow others to tune or reuse existing content.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"make-your-training-materials-reusable-for-trainers\">Make your training materials (re)usable for trainers</h2>\n<p>To help others determine whether the training materials are relevant and adaptable to their particular situations, metadata published alongside training materials should include context and sufficient description including: contributor details, license, description, learning outcomes, audience, requirements, tags/keywords, duration and last revision date Applying the proper licence and tagging training materials with metadata can make it simpler for others to (re)use and adapt them.</p>\n\n<p>GTN provide strong technical support and set of <a href=\"/training-material/topics/contributing/index.html\">contributing self learning material</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"make-your-training-materials-usable-for-trainees\">Make your training materials usable for trainees</h2>\n<p>Prerequisites and learning outcomes are particularly helpful metadata. To be effective, learning objectives must be written using active verbs that describe the expected trainee behaviours as well as the knowledge, skills, and expertise they will have received. Rich metadata requirements and SMART—Specific (Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound) learning outcomes following Bloom’s taxonomy <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#chevron2014metacognitive\">Chevron 2014</a></span> helps to clarify which trainees will benefit most from the training. Self-learning structure of the GTN materials supported by slides and video walkthroughs/tours adds another layer of usability.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"make-your-training-materials-contribution-friendly\">Make your training materials contribution friendly</h2>\n<p>GTN have clear <a href=\"/training-material/topics/contributing/tutorials/create-new-tutorial/tutorial.html\">guidelines</a> for contribution and involvement. Community supported CONTRIBUTING files and chat offer the chance to exchange information such as contact details, expectations for contributions, and more. All contributors should be listed and thanked in the acknowledgements; how to cite the tutorial and give credit to contributors can be found at the end of each tutorial.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"keep-your-training-materials-up-to-date\">Keep your training materials up-to-date</h2>\n<p>It is crucial to keep your training materials up-to-date and so you are aware of any new features, trends, or improvements in the topic (such as updated tools or databases). Transparent peer-review and curation process in collaborative and open set up ensure materials quality.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>There are many ways to improve the training content. It is crucial that we work together to make training materials FAIR so that everyone can benefit from them. These simple suggestions are intended to encourage dialogue and cooperation among Galaxy training community and help bring the latest developments to users.</p>\n\n<p>The Galaxy Training Network is an example of a robust, effective Community of Practice.\nFor more information please look at this great article <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#hiltemann2023galaxy\">Hiltemann <i>et al.</i> 2023</a></span>, the corresponding FAIR guidelines <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#fair-training-materials\">“<b>How does the GTN ensure our training materials are FAIR?</b>”</a></span> and follow <a href=\"http://fellowship.elixiruknode.org/\">short introduction to FAIR data stewardship</a>.</p>\n"],"ref_slides":[],"hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2024-06-17 13:07:04 +0000","pub_date":"2024-06-17 13:07:04 +0000","version":0,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/contributing/tutorials/fair-gtn/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":[],"topic_name_human":"Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","contributors":[{"name":"Katarzyna Kamieniecka","twitter":"katemurat","orcid":"0009-0004-2454-5950","joined":"2018-08","elixir_node":"uk","affiliations":["elixir-europe"],"id":"kkamieniecka","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/kkamieniecka.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/kkamieniecka/"},{"name":"Krzysztof Poterlowicz","twitter":"bioinfbrad","orcid":"0000-0001-6173-5674","joined":"2017-09","elixir_node":"uk","affiliations":["elixir-europe"],"id":"poterlowicz-lab","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/poterlowicz-lab.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/poterlowicz-lab/"},{"name":"Helena Rasche","orcid":"0000-0001-9760-8992","maintainer_contact":"gitter","matrix":"hexylena:matrix.org","joined":"2017-09","elixir_node":"nl","affiliations":["gallantries","by-covid","erasmusmc","elixir-europe","elixir-converge"],"former_affiliations":["deNBI","avans-atgm","uni-freiburg"],"contact_for_training":false,"location":{"country":"NL","lat":51.91,"lon":4.46},"id":"hexylena","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/contributors/hexylena.json","page":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/hexylena/"},{"name":"DASH UK","joined":"2023-10","github":false,"avatar":"/training-material/shared/images/dash.png","url":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/funders/elixir-uk-dash.json","funder":true,"funding_system":"ukri","funding_id":"MR/V038966/1","funding_statement":"This Fellowship was funded through the ELIXIR-UK DaSH project as part of the UKRI Innovation Scholars: Data Science Training in Health and Bioscience call (DaSH).
