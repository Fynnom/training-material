id=\"tips-for-instructors\">Tips for instructors</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-the-training-material\">Using the Training Material</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Decide (individually or together) if you will:</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Run through the tutorial with them step by step, waiting for everyone at each step</li>\n      <li>OR allow trainees to follow along at their own pace</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>Each of these options has pros and cons:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>Step by step</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Pro: everyone is on the same step, helpers can see similar errors at similar times that they can point out to the group at once</li>\n          <li>Con: Some trainees will be faster, and some will be slower. If you wait for everyone it may cause you to go at a slower pace than expected, depending on their skill levels</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>At their own pace:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Pro: Those who want to explore features have time to do so. If they are intrigued by the workflow editor, they can play around with it for some time before moving on.</li>\n          <li>Con: People will finish at wildly different times. Be prepared for some users to be done and maybe encourage them with a list of things they can do after they’ve completed the tutorial, or additional reading material, or just encourage them to try different parameters.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Will you present slides? Make sure these are prepared ahead of time. The Training Material offers introductory slides for many topics and many tutorials. See if you can contribute your slides back, if the topic does not currently have any.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"unexpected-situations\">(Un)expected situations</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"students-asking-extremely-specific-questions\">Students asking extremely specific questions</h3>\n\n<p>Occasionally students will either want to show off their knowledge on specific topics, or will just want special attention with their particular research question.\nIf you can answer the question briefly then this can be good. Otherwise just ask them to bring it up with you during the next break.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interruptions\">Interruptions</h3>\n\n<p>There are many kinds of interruptions that can occur:</p>\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Fire alarm / evacuate the classroom</dt>\n  <dd>There is not much you can do in this situation. If they bring their stuff with them (they shouldn’t if it’s a fire alarm), then consider continuing outside. However this can be unpleasant for participants due to weather, or too much sun on their laptops. Make a break, point out nearby attractions, and make a plan to meat back in 30 minutes.</dd>\n  <dt>Internet / Server Outage</dt>\n  <dd>Can you estimate how long this will last? If it is going to be a short interruption, this can be a good time to recap briefly and then ask questions of the students, or suggest students should ask their questions. If it will be a long outage, you can switch to your backup server, OR you can walk the students through the rest of the steps. Be sure to go slowly and be detailed with what would have happened during the steps that they will miss.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>(Any others?)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"unsocial-participants\">Unsocial participants</h3>\n\n<p>Not everyone is always outwardly enthusiastic about the course for any number of reasons; some students may be very introverted, maybe haven’t had their coffee yet, were told to be there by their boss, or just not willing to be social. While you cannot force them everyone, you can encourage try and make activities cover a wide range of groups, from small to large. Some people will be more willing to join smaller groups, or will be more than willing to interact with you one-on-one. Ice breakers that involve one-on-one conversations can be good, a nice one is to have a ‘bingo’ chart with various aspects about researchers (has PhD, works with viruses, is from local city, is from outside of the country, etc.) and ask them to find people matching these attributes. This allows them to have more personal conversations.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"checklists\">Checklists</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"before-the-workshop\">Before the workshop</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Read the <a href=\"https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/24-practices/\">teaching recommendations</a> of Software Carpentry</li>\n  <li>Read the <a href=\"/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/organize-workshop/tutorial.html\">organiser recommendations</a> and see if there is anything you can help with</li>\n  <li>Decide on the order of the lessons and who will teach what with the organizers</li>\n  <li>Assist the host in recruiting helpers (people to walk around the classroom and help people if they get stuck)</li>\n  <li>Assist the host in ensuring the workshop location is accessible and everything is ready for the students</li>\n  <li>Share emergency contact information with host in case of last minute changes</li>\n  <li>Practice teaching the material</li>\n  <li>Remind the host of any special equipment you might need (e.g. Mac connector)</li>\n  <li>Confirm criteria for reimbursement (per diem or save receipts)</li>\n  <li>Create a recap with the different formats and workflows taught during the workshop and print them</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"prepare-your-galaxy\">Prepare your Galaxy</h3>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Identify where you will run the training:</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        <p>A Public Galaxy?</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>UseGalaxy.org?
