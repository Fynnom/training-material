But motivation is key to learning. If we want to enhance motivation, we have to learn a bit how motivation works.\nMotivation is personal and it is very difficult to work with demotivated learners. Often, teachers cannot do much with deep lack of motivation. Here, we want to see what can trainers do to enhance motivation.\nAdult learners usually come motivated to courses and the point is to not demotivate them.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>Resources / Reading recommendation</comment-title>\n\n  <p>This tutorial is significantly based on the 3rd session of ELIXIR Train the Trainer curriculum, but also:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://teachtogether.tech\">Teaching Tech Together <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#wilson2019teaching\">Wilson 2019</a></span></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6743627/How_Learning_Works_Seven_Research_Based_Principles_for_Smart_Teaching_Susan_A_Ambrose_Michael_W_Bridges_Michele_DiPietro_Marsha_C_Lovett_Marie_K_Norman_with_a_Foreword_by_Richard_E_Mayer\">How Learning works, <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#ambrose2010learning\">Ambrose <i>et al.</i> 2010</a></span></a></li>\n    <li>Understanding how we learn <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#weinstein2018understanding\">Weinstein <i>et al.</i> 2018</a></span></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html\">Instructor Training, The Carpentries</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p>To get ready to teach this tutorial</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Read the chapter “What factors motivate Students to learn?” in <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/6743627/How_Learning_Works_Seven_Research_Based_Principles_for_Smart_Teaching_Susan_A_Ambrose_Michael_W_Bridges_Michele_DiPietro_Marsha_C_Lovett_Marie_K_Norman_with_a_Foreword_by_Richard_E_Mayer\">How Learning works, <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#ambrose2010learning\">Ambrose <i>et al.</i> 2010</a></span></a></li>\n    <li>Check <a href=\"https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/index.html\">“Motivation and Demotivation” section</a>, Instructor Training, The Carpentries</li>\n  </ul>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\">\n  <agenda-title></agenda-title>\n\n  <p>In this tutorial, we will cover:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n  <li><a href=\"#motivation\" id=\"markdown-toc-motivation\">Motivation</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#goals\" id=\"markdown-toc-goals\">Goals</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#value\" id=\"markdown-toc-value\">Value</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#expectancies\" id=\"markdown-toc-expectancies\">Expectancies</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#learning-environment\" id=\"markdown-toc-learning-environment\">Learning environment</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#demotivation\" id=\"markdown-toc-demotivation\">Demotivation</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#things-you-should-not-do-as-instructors\" id=\"markdown-toc-things-you-should-not-do-as-instructors\">Things you should not do as instructors</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#strategies-to-improve-motivation-and-avoid-demotivation\" id=\"markdown-toc-strategies-to-improve-motivation-and-avoid-demotivation\">Strategies to improve motivation and avoid demotivation</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#what-can-we-do-to-increase-learners-motivation\" id=\"markdown-toc-what-can-we-do-to-increase-learners-motivation\">What can we do to increase learners’ motivation?</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#conclusion\" id=\"markdown-toc-conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h1>\n\n<p>What is motivation?</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Motivation refers to the <strong>personal investment</strong> that an individual has in reaching a desired state or outcome (<span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#maehr1997understanding\">Maehr and Meyer 1997</a></span>)</li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Learning</strong> results from what the <strong>student does and thinks</strong> and <strong>only</strong> from what the student does and thinks. <strong>The teacher</strong> can advance learning only by influencing what the student <strong>does</strong> to learn (Herbert A.
