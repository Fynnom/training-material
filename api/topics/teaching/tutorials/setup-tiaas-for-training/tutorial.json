For trainings we attach a new group of VMs that is specially labelled for that training. When normal users run tools on our server, these jobs are instructed to avoid the training pools by default.\n</p>\n<p class=\"AsiaPacific-APAC\">\nWe have a pool of virtual machines (VMs) dedicated to training, that run training specific jobs only.\n</p>\n<p class=\"the-Americas-AMER\">\nJobs submitted while in a TIaaS group have an artificially capped memory limited, and walltime. By lowering these parameters we can be sure the jobs will execute more quickly, but this only works for training data. If you run a training with \"real data\" it may require too much memory or computation time, and those jobs will be killed.\n</p>\n\n<p>When your users join a training, using a special URL provided to you, they then are placed in a special training group. Their jobs will then preferentially run on a training machine, and, in the event there is no more capacity, they will run on the main queue. If a spot on a training VM opens up first, they will run there rather than continuing to wait in the main queue.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-application-process\">The Application Process</h1>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Apply for TIaaS Training</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p><span class=\"Europe-the-Middle-East-and-Africa-EMEA\"><a href=\"https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/new/\">Fill out the form</a></span><span class=\"AsiaPacific-APAC\"><a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org.au/tiaas/new/\">Fill out the form</a></span><span class=\"the-Americas-AMER\"><a href=\"https://usegalaxy.org/tiaas/new/\">Fill out the form</a></span></p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>The admin team will review the request and get in touch with you as needed to identify the compute resources you need for your training</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <p>The admin team will inform you of the URL you should provide to your participants during the training.

It’s really that easy for students.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-status-dashboard\">The Status Dashboard</h1>\n\n<p>Once your students are registered, and you’re running your training, a common question instructors ask are “Are you all done?” and students are often not as vocal or repsonsive as we would like. So the TIaaS service now has a dashboard you can view which shows you the queue status for everyone in your training group. This works by finding all of the members of that training group, and checking all jobs that were created in the last 3 hours. For all of those jobs, this is displayed as a simple dashboard with the status of these jobs:</p>\n\n<p>It shows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Overview of queue (how many are in state new/queued/ok/error)</li>\n  <li>Overview split by tools (how many people are done running Fastqc?)</li>\n  <li>A full listing of the queue</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"../../images/tiaas-status.png\" alt=\"TIaaS Queue Status. \" width=\"1503\" height=\"1001\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"../../images/tiaas-status.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> The TIaaS Status dashboard gives you an overview of all jobs states (are they ok or not), as well as a breakdown by tool. This is useful for finding out if everyone is finished running FastQC this morning and if they mostly worked OK. Finally it gives you a detailed breakdown, shown in the order they were submitted. This can give you a more detailed feeling for how the students are progressing through the tutorial.</figcaption></figure>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>View the dashboard</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>The status dashboard is just the same URL as to join the group, with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">/status</code> at the end: <a href=\"https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test/status\">https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test/status</a></li>\n  </ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"before-your-training\">Before Your Training</h1>\n\n<p><strong>At least 2 weeks</strong> before your training:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Run through your planned trainings on the UseGalaxy.eu server to ensure everything is available including data libraries and tools.</li>\n  <li>If anything is missing, contact the admins and they will work to resolve the missing training material resources.</li>\n  <li>Follow the rest of the training material’s <a href=\"/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/organize-workshop/tutorial.html\">guide to preparing a workshop</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1 id=\"during-your-training\">During Your Training</h1>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Check out your status dashboard</li>\n  <li>Watch for problems and contact the admins if\n    <ul>\n      <li>Jobs are spending abnormally long in the queue</li>\n      <li>Jobs are failing unexpectedly</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Remind your participants to submit bug reports if they experience any tool errors</li>\n  <li>Follow the rest of the training material’s <a href=\"/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/running-workshop/tutorial.html\">guide to running a workshop</a></li>\n</ol>\n"],"ref_slides":[],"video_library":{"tutorial":null,"slides":null,"demo":null,"both":null,"session":null},"hands_on":true,"slides":false,"mod_date":"2023-12-20 11:53:42 +0000","pub_date":"2018-11-15 12:26:10 +0000","version":3,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/teaching/tutorials/setup-tiaas-for-training/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":[],"topic_name_human":"Teaching and Hosting Galaxy training","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial"}
