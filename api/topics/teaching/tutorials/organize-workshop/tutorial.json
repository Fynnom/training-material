Some things to consider include:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>Tables arranged so participants can watch the instructor, use their laptops, and talk with their peers</p>\n\n        <p>Fold up desks are usually not a good choice.</p>\n\n        <p>If a computer pool or computer room is available, these are usually a good choice since they come equipped with desktops and large monitors. If you allow students to bring their own laptops, they will sometimes bring very tiny ones and then struggle to read tutorials at the same time as following along.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>Tables arranged so helpers and instructors can easily walk around the room and talk with individual participants</li>\n      <li>A room with a projector and screen that everyone can see, with HDMI, VGA, and Mac adapters to allow anyone to plug in their laptop</li>\n      <li>Hi speed internet access (WiFi if not in a computer room) that can support everyone using it simultaneously</li>\n      <li>\n        <p>High table or podium that instructor can stand behind while teaching</p>\n\n        <p>A flat podium is important; it’s difficult to use a laptop on a slanted podium</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>Black/white boards can be useful for drawing diagrams. These work best in smaller rooms, in larger rooms people sometimes cannot see from the back, and slides can be better here</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Ensure your location is accessible for those with different needs</p>\n\n    <p>It’s important to make sure the workshop space is accessible to all individuals. The registration form should ask whether instructors, helpers, or learners need any advance arrangements to ensure they can participate in the event. This may include considering whether or not:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Building and room are accessible to those who can not use stairs (ramps, elevators, etc.)</li>\n      <li>Restrooms are accessible</li>\n      <li>There is a microphone for instructors</li>\n      <li>The screen is large enough and bright enough to be easily read</li>\n      <li>The building and room can accommodate service animals</li>\n      <li>Lactation space is provided</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.adaatyourservice.org/accessible-meetings-events-conferences-guide/book\">Here is an additional (US-centric)</a> guide book covering all aspects of event accessibility required under the ADA in the US.

If you choose to have participants find their own lunch, then you should add nearby lunch location ideas to the workshop webpage</li>\n      <li>If your workshop is a multi-day workshop, you should include dinner options on the workshop webpage</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Test the projector with a different computers</li>\n  <li>Contact participants to remind them of workshop webpage where you have written location/directions, start/end times, and contact information</li>\n  <li>Contact instructors and help to remind them of workshop webpage</li>\n  <li>Make a reservation for a social dinner</li>\n  <li>Prepare the participation certificates</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Test the training materials that will be taught from the perspective of a student in the room you have booked</p>\n\n    <p>In one case the training material was taught in English, but the computers were in German. Some participants could not find the “Copy link location” that was mentioned in the tutorial. If you have sections that instruct users to do things like this, make sure to check how they will see it!</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>Name badges for the instructors, usually with a different colour border so attendees can identify people who can help them with any issues they encounter.</li>\n  <li>Name badges for attendees are important for participants as well. At busy venues it can help attendees to find each other and remember each others’ names.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that your catering service will label the food for contents (e.g. for vegetarian/vegan/allergens like gluten, etc.) This is extremely important for attendees to be able to enjoy themselves and find food that will not hurt them.</li>\n  <li>Identify places you can promote your event <a href=\"https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub\">Galaxy Hub</a> is the primary place to do this.
