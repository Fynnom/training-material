When the guests taste the soup, what's done is done (the chef can't change anything in the recipe for these guests). But they can still change the recipe for the future guests (future students). In formative assessment, the instructor can direct the learning on the fly, correct the direction, address mistakes/misconceptions/missing knowledged. In summative assessment, the learners have passed a test and they can't go back in time to do it better. The mark was decided. A summative assessment can indicate how the teaching was (if the instructor realises that the whole class of learners did poorly in the exam, this indicates that the teaching may be a cause), but in the best case scenario she can improve her course for the next cohort of learners (not for those who had finished the course/semester/year)</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>In training, the scope here, the focus is on formative assessment (collect information / feedback on how learning is progressing).

At an in-person workshop, paper sticky notes double as minute cards, with the two different colors used for positive and constructive feedback. At an online workshop, this may be done by making a copy of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview\">Virtual Minute Card Template</a> from the Carpentries on Google Forms. Other tools can work as well, but we do recommend making sure that feedback is private and anonymous. A public-facing sticky note board will receive different (and less useful) feedback.</p>\n\n<p>During long breaks, instructors read through the minute cards and look for patterns. At the start of each half day, the Instructors take a few minutes to address commonly raised issues with the whole class. The non-teaching Instructor can also type answers to the questions in the Etherpad.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to get instant feedback is the <strong>Fist of five</strong>. It is a simple format for asking for agreement or disagreement, or understanding on a topic by a show of hands. Each hand signal has a different meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Fist: “I do not understand”</li>\n  <li>1 finger – index finger: “I have (major) concerns that need to be heard and resolved immediately.”</li>\n  <li>2 Fingers – index finger and middle finger or thumb and index finger: “I have (minor) concerns that we need to resolve now.”</li>\n  <li>3 fingers – thumb, index finger and middle finger or index finger, middle finger and ring finger: “I have (minor) concerns but can live with the continuying. My concerns should be resolved soon.”</li>\n  <li>4 Fingers – Index finger, middle finger, ring finger and little finger or thumb, index finger, middle finger and ring finger: “I got it.”</li>\n  <li>5 fingers (Five) – Showing open hand: “I am enthusiastic and we can continue”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"multiple-choice-question-mcq-to-evaluate-mental-models\">Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) to evaluate mental models</h4>\n\n<p>Look at this example of a MCQ</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Question: “What is 27+15 ?”</li>\n  <li>Possible answers\n    <ul>\n      <li>42</li>\n      <li>32</li>\n      <li>312</li>\n      <li>33</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Correct answer: 42, but each of the other answers provides valuable insights</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title>Multiple Choice Questions and mental models</question-title>\n\n  <p>In the previous MCQ, which misconception is associated with</p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>32</li>\n    <li>312</li>\n    <li>33</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <blockquote class=\"solution\">\n    <solution-title></solution-title>\n    <ol>\n      <li>If they answer 32, they are throwing away the carry completely.</li>\n      <li>If they answer 312, they know that they can’t just discard the carried ‘1’, but doesn’t understand that it’s actually a ten and needs to be added into the next column.
