You will see that we are talking about an actual change of paradigm.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"active-interactive-and-collaborative-learning\">Active, interactive and collaborative learning</h2>\n\n<p>From <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#felder2009active\">Felder and Brent 2009</a></span>, <strong>Active Learning</strong> (also called “Guide on the side”) is anything course-related that all students in a class session are called upon to do other than simply watching, listening and taking notes (aka typical teachning practice or “Sage on stage” approach):</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Typical teaching practice: lecturing</th>\n      <th>Active learning</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Teacher-centered</td>\n      <td>Student-centered</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Teaching by telling</td>\n      <td>Teaching by questioning</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Teacher speaks and students listen</td>\n      <td>Collaborative learning</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Few interactions student/teacher and student/student</td>\n      <td>High interactivity (student/teacher, and student/student)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Few questions</td>\n      <td>Discussion with teacher follows, not precedes</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>The same few students engaged</td>\n      <td>All students engaged</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Do you recognise the paradigm change proposed by Eric Mazur?</p>\n\n<p>With the help of Mazur, you hopefully started believing that active, interactive and collaborative learning is worth considering and deserves you give it a go in one of your future training courses.Should this be the case, you may have questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>how do I choose the active learning techniques for my lessons?</li>\n  <li>what “active learning” means in terms of “teaching / training practices”?</li>\n  <li>which is the most effective technique I can incorporate in my teaching?</li>\n  <li>is there any “ideal” teaching technique I should absolutely learn?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is <strong>not “the” ideal teaching technique nor the “most effective” teaching technique.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You may remember from the Nichols’ steps of curriculum design, that it is <strong>essential that you align learning experiences to the learning outcomes</strong> of your course. In other words, for each LO, you should identify the learning experience(s) that will best support the achievement of the LO.</p>\n\n<p>More generally, to decide how to teach and choose the <strong>most appropriate learning experience(s)</strong>, you may use <strong>three criteria</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>What is your <strong>purpose / goal</strong> (is it to inspire learners? is it to ensure they will remember a concept?)</li>\n  <li>The <strong>Bloom’s level</strong> at which you intend to teach (a specific topic; this may change from topic to topic)</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The <strong>learning outcome(s)</strong> the learning experience is designed for</p>\n\n    <p>For example, a lecture is not suitable to teach learners implement an algorithm. It may show how to do it, so that they may be able to describe how to do it, but if you want them to be able to do it, you will have to choose a learning experience where learners will have the chance to practice algorithm implementation.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Inspired by Eric Mazur and the idea of active learning, <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#via2020course\">Via <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span> created this useful table to reinforce the concepts discussed in previously and provide with criteria to choose the <strong>most suitable learning experience(s) for the Bloom’s level, TG(s) and LO(s)</strong>:</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Learning experience</th>\n      <th>Highest Bloom’s levels supported</th>\n      <th>Example TG(s) <em>“This LE will allow me to…“</em></th>\n      <th>Example LO(s) <em>“Learners will be able to…“</em></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Lecture, webinar</td>\n      <td>Remember, Comprehend</td>\n      <td>Inspire learners, ignite learners’ enthusiasm, clarify/explain a concept, provide an overview, give context, summarise content</td>\n      <td><em>list</em> the key points of the lecture/webinar, <em>summarise</em> take home message(s)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Exercise, practical</td>\n      <td>Apply, Analyse</td>\n      <td>Help learners digest course materials, solve typical problems, apply knowledge, show how to do things with appropriate guidance, give an idea of how a tool works</td>\n      <td><em>follow</em> a set of instructions or protocol, <em>calculate</em> a set of results or outcomes from a given protocol</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Flipped class</td>\n      <td>Apply, Analyse</td>\n      <td>Teach learners how to formulate questions, help learners to memorise new information &amp; concepts, or analyse &amp; understand course materials</td>\n      <td><em>summarise</em> the content material, <em>ask</em> appropriate questions</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Peer instruction</td>\n      <td>Synthesise, Evaluate</td>\n      <td>Prepare learners to defend an argument, give learners opportunities to explain things, thereby helping to develop critical thinking &amp; awareness</td>\n      <td><em>explain</em> how they solved an exercise, <em>evaluate</em> others’ choices/decisions, <em>diagnose</em> errors in the exercise-solving task</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Group discussion</td>\n      <td>Synthesise, Evaluate</td>\n      <td>Give learners opportunities to practice questioning, develop new ideas &amp; critical thinking</td>\n      <td><em>communicate</em> their own ideas, <em>defend</em> their own opinions</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Group work</td>\n      <td>Synthesise, Evaluate</td>\n      <td>Promote collaborative work &amp; peer instruction, provide opportunities for giving/receiving feedback, &amp; digesting course materials</td>\n      <td><em>provide</em> feedback on their peers’ work, <em>share</em> ideas, <em>explain</em> the advantages of team-work</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Problem-solving</td>\n      <td>Synthesise, Evaluate</td>\n      <td>Promote learner abilities to identify &amp; evaluate solutions, develop new ideas, make decisions, evaluate decision effectiveness, troubleshoot</td>\n      <td><em>diagnose</em> faulty reasoning or an underperforming result, <em>correct</em> errors</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<blockquote class=\"comment\">\n  <comment-title>Learning experience vs Teaching practice</comment-title>\n\n  <p>In the table, Learning experience (from the learner point of view) is the Teaching practice (from the teacher point of view).</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should be kind of familiar with some of the learning experiences listed in the table, e.g., lecture/webinar, group discussion, work in groups, problem solving. Some of you might not be familiar with the techniques of “peer instruction” and “flipped classroom”.</p>\n\n<p>These two techniques can be implemented in many different ways and incorporated into your course in a “light way” or very extensively. This will depend on your familiarity with the technique. At the beginning, our suggestion is that you try with something “minima”, test it, see how you feel and how learners receive it, and then you increase the amount of learning experiences involving peer instruction and flipped classroom.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"peer-instruction\">Peer instruction</h2>\n\n<p>Peer instruction is a 1-to-1 instruction done in a scalable way by <strong>interleaving formative assessment with learner discussion</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"details\">\n  <details-title>Peer-to-peer or peer-learning: what is it? - <i class=\"fas fa-hourglass-half\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">time</span> 2-min video</details-title>\n\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MYa4hgcMRNc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In its “traditional” form, the teacher</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Gives a brief introduction to the topic.</li>\n  <li>Gives learners a multiple choice question (MCQ) that probes for their misconceptions</li>\n  <li>Has all the learners vote on their answers to the MCQ\n    <ol>\n      <li>If the learners all have the <strong>right</strong> answer, move on</li>\n      <li>If they all have the same wrong answer, <strong>address</strong> that specific misconception</li>\n      <li>If they have a mix of right and wrong answers, give them several minutes to argue with each other in groups of 2–4, then vote again</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You may also be creative and implement this technique in your own way.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"details\">\n  <details-title>Concept Tests at Avanti's Learning Centre in Kanpur - <i class=\"fas fa-hourglass-half\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">time</span> 2-min video</details-title>\n\n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LbuoxAy56o\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"details\">\n  <details-title>Does that work?</details-title>\n\n  <p>It has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts, including programming (references??).

Monitoring the shared notes, keeping an eye on the learners to see who’s struggling, jotting down some feedback to give your teaching partner at the next break—anything that contributes to the lesson is better than anything that doesn’t.</li>\n        <li>Take a few minutes when the class is over to congratulate or commiserate with each other</li>\n      </ul>\n    </blockquote>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Assess prior knowledge and mental models</strong> to tailor the lesson on learners’ actual needs, to address misconceptions, to learn about your learners (see <a href=\"/training-material/topics/teaching/tutorials/assessment/tutorial.html\">dedicated tutorial</a>). The more you know about your learners before you start teaching, the more you will be able to help them.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Learn learners names and use them</strong></p>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Avoid homework in All-day formats</strong>: Learners who have spent an entire day programming will be tired. If you give them homework to do after hours, they’ll start the next day tired as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of the techniques presented here will make your classes better, but <strong>you shouldn’t try to adopt them all at once</strong>. The reason is that every new practice increases <em>your</em> cognitive load as well as your learners’, since you are all now trying to learn a new way to learn as well as the lesson’s subject matter. If you are working with a group repeatedly, you can introduce one new technique every few lessons; if you only have them for a one-day workshop, it’s best to pick just one method they haven’t seen before and get them comfortable with that.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<!--\n\n\n<div markdown=\"1\">\n> <div class=\"box-title\" aria-label=\"quiz box: What is the highest Bloom's
