They represent selected screenshots of networks explored as a live demo in the video associated with these slides.\n---\n#Uncorrected P model\n<br>\nPhylogenetic network of _Anolis_ species created in SplitsTree using the uncorrected P model. \n![Circular phylogenetic network with many branches splitting outwards from a central point to multiple Anolis species at the periphery. The network is oriented so that the species Diplolaemus darwinii and Phenacosaurus acutirostrus appear on the right hand side.](images/06-networks-uncorrectedP.png)\n---\n#Exploring splits\n<br>\nClick on the branches of the network to explore different splits. Here _A. ahli_ appears in two different splits highlighted in yellow.\n\n.pull-left[ ![Screen shot of a circular phylogenetic network with multiple branches splitting out from a central point.

We will follow the split containing _A. lineatopus_ and _A. limifrons_ through different models.\n\n![Screen shot of a circular phylogenetic network with multiple branches splitting out from a central point.

Note that the species _A. limifrons_ appears in two alternate splits.\n\n.pull-left[ ![Screen shot of a circular phylogenetic network with multiple branches splitting out from a central point.
