Luckily, we have programs like FastTree to do some adjustment!\n\n---\n\n#Thank you!\n<br>\n<br>\n_Next - estimating trees from alignments_\n---\n\n\n\n"],"hands_on":false,"slides":true,"mod_date":"2024-04-23 01:55:40 +0000","pub_date":"2024-05-10 11:23:12 +0000","version":11,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/evolution/tutorials/abc_intro_phylo-trees/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Evolution","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"video":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":false},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","redirect_from":["/short/evolution/abc_intro_phylo-trees/slides","/short/S00121"]}
