aim to calculate the genetic differences (in SNPs) between pairs of MTB genomes.\nTo do so, we need to compare, between each pair of genomes (thus pairwise), the nucleotides that are\nobserved at each position. Each time we find a different nucleotide at a given position, we will sum\n1 SNP of genetic distance. For example, if two strains have a genetic distance of 5 SNPs, that would\nmean that their respective genomes are almost identical, except for 5 positions along all the genome\nin which they have different nucleotides.</p>\n\n<p>To do such calculation we need to first build an alignment of all the genomes (a multiple-sequence alignment, or MSA).\nAfterwards, we will use specific software to analyze this MSA, count SNPs, and thus calculate the genetic distance between each pair of samples.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-1\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/MSA.png\" alt=\"MSA of 5 MTB genomes. \" width=\"500\" height=\"129\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/MSA.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 1</strong>:</span> A SNP is highlighted in a MSA of five MTB genomes</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"generate-complete-genomes\">Generate complete genomes</h3>\n\n<p>The first step to generate the genomes MSA will be… to get the complete genomes of our samples!\nIn the <a href=\"/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/tb-variant-analysis/tutorial.html\">MTB Variant Analysis tutorial</a> we have analyzed short-read high-throughput sequencing data (Illumina) to\nobtain the respective VCF files that describe the mutations found in each of our samples, as compared\nto the reference genome. We can now use these VCF files to build the complete genome of each of our\nsamples.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"filter-vcf-files-for-epidemiologicalphylogenetic-investigation\">Filter VCF files for epidemiological/phylogenetic investigation</h4>\n<p>Interpreting <strong>mixed calls</strong> or <strong>indels</strong> in phylogenetic/epidemiological applications can be very\ncomplicated. That is the reason why we typically use alignments that only contain <strong>fixed SNPs</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the first step in this tutorial will be to filter the VCFs so we are sure that\nthey only contain <strong>fixed SNPs</strong>, which we (somewhat arbitrarily) define as those single-nucleotide variants that are observed at an allele frequency of 90% or greater. We will be using the tool <strong>TB Variant Filter</strong> for this task.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: TB variant Filter refers to SNPs as SNVs.

Well, we are going to use a trick. We are going to\njust stack one genome on top of each other within a text file. (More on why we can do this below).</p>\n\n<p>Our aim is to generate a <strong>multifasta</strong> dataset in which the genomes of our samples are aligned.\nSomething that looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>&gt;Sample 1\nTTGACCGATGACCCCGGTTCAGGCTTCACCACAGTGTGGAACGC...\n&gt;Sample 2\nATGACCGATGACCCCGGTTCAGGCTTCACCACAGTGTGGAACGC...\n&gt;Sample 3\nTTCGTTCGATGACCCCGGTTCAGGCTTCACCACAGTGTGGAACG...\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This could be done manually, by copy-pasting all genomes in a single text file.\nHowever we can do the same with a specific command that <em>concatenates</em> datasets.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Concatenate genomes to build a MSA</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li><span class=\"tool\" data-tool=\"toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_cat/0.1.1\" title=\"Concatenate datasets tail-to-head (cat) tool\" aria-role=\"button\"><i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Concatenate datasets tail-to-head (cat)</strong> (<i class=\"fas fa-cubes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Galaxy version 0.1.1)</span> with the following parameters:\n      <ul>\n        <li><i class=\"far fa-folder\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">param-collection</span> <em>“Datasets to concatenate”</em>: the collection of consensus genomes; output of <strong>bcftools consensus</strong></li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now we have a multifasta file, where <strong>each position of each genome corresponds to the same position\nof the rest of genomes in the file</strong>. This can be seen and used as a multiple-sequence alignment of\nall of our genomes! However, it is important that you understand the following question…</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title></question-title>\n\n  <p>Generating multiple-sequence alignments can be complicated and computationally demanding, and there are\nmany software packages to perform such task. How is it possible that we were able to build a MSA by just\nstacking genomes one on top of each other? Can you think about what makes our case special, so we can\njust use this “trick”?</p>\n\n  <blockquote class=\"solution\">\n    <solution-title></solution-title>\n\n    <p>We have generated the complete genome of each sample by substituting in the reference genome\nthose <strong>SNPs</strong> that we found in that said sample (described in the VCF). Remember that <strong>we\nremoved indels from the VCF when filtering!</strong> Because the complete genomes we generated do not\ncontain insertions or deletions, ALL the genomes have the same length (the length of the\nreference genome) and each nucleotide corresponds to the same genomic coordinate (the one\nalso in the reference genome). So we are not aligning genomes <em>per se</em> and, knowing this, we\ncan build a MSA by just stacking genomes that <strong>are the same length »AND« have the same coordinates</strong>.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"remove-invariant-positions\">Remove invariant positions</h3>\n\n<p>We have generated a MSA that is the basis for the transmission (clustering) and phylogenetic\nanalysis. Although we could already use this MSA for such analysis, it is common practice to remove\nthe invariant sites from the alignment. Think that our file now contains 20 genomes of 4.4 Mb each.\nMTB genomes have a very low genetic diversity, meaning that in reality, there are only some hundreds or\nthousands of SNPs <em>in total</em>, because the genomes are &gt;99% identical between them. Identical positions\nin a MSA provide no information, so we can remove those and\ngenerate a <strong>SNP alignment</strong> that only contain variant positions with phylogenetic information. By\ndoing this, we will generate a much smaller file, that will be easier to handle by downstream applications.</p>\n\n<p>We can exemplify this with a couple of pictures:</p>\n\n<p>In the following picture, a polymorphic position in the alignment (SNP)\nis highlighted in blue and green. Invariant positions are not highlighted and have an asterisc <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">*</code>\non the upper part of the alignment. Most of the MSA is composed of these invariant positions, making\nour file larger than necessary.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-2\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/MSA.png\" alt=\"MSA of 5 MTB genomes. \" width=\"500\" height=\"129\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/MSA.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 2</strong>:</span> A SNP is highlighted in a MSA of five MTB genomes</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>After removing invariant positions, we end up with a SNP alignment like the following.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-3\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/SNP_MSA.png\" alt=\"MSA of 5 MTB genomes. \" width=\"626\" height=\"129\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/SNP_MSA.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 3</strong>:</span> A SNP alignment where all positions are polymorphic</figcaption></figure>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Removing invariant sites from a MSA</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li><span class=\"tool\" data-tool=\"toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/snp_sites/snp_sites/2.5.1+galaxy0\" title=\"Finds SNP sites tool\" aria-role=\"button\"><i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>Finds SNP sites</strong> (<i class=\"fas fa-cubes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Galaxy version 2.5.1+galaxy0)</span> with the following parameters:\n      <ul>\n        <li><i class=\"far fa-file\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">param-file</span> <em>“FASTA file”</em>: the concatenated consensus genomes; output of <strong>Concatenate datasets</strong></li>\n        <li><em>“Output”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Sequence alignment / VCF</code>\n          <ul>\n            <li><em>“Output formats”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Multi-FASTA alignment file</code></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In SNP alignments you have to <strong>bear in mind that positions do not longer correspond to genomic\ncoordinates</strong>, meaning that two contiguous nucleotides may correspond to coordinates thousands of\npositions apart.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"identify-transmission-clusters\">Identify transmission clusters</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"calculate-pairwise-snp-distances\">Calculate pairwise SNP distances</h3>\n\n<p>Now we are all set to calculate pairwise SNP distances between samples and decide whether two\npatients are within the same transmission cluster or not.

If two samples are at a distance below that threshold, we will say that they\nbelong to the same transmission cluster, because they are close enough genetically speaking. Again,\nwe could do this manually, but we are doing bioinformatics, and we want to be able to do the same\nanalysis regardless of whether we are analyzing two or two million samples.

Do you know why?</p>\n\n  <blockquote class=\"solution\">\n    <solution-title></solution-title>\n    <p>The strain is indeed PZA-resistant. And indeed this is strain is NOT linked to transmission\nwithin our population. However, if we have a look at the TB-profiler report, we observe that this\nis a <em>M. bovis</em> strain, which are known to be intrinsically resistant to PZA.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote class=\"question\">\n  <question-title></question-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>Is it possible to find, in the same transmission cluster, two RIF-monoresistant strains that\ncarry different rpoB mutations?</li>\n    <li>Is it possible to find, in the same transmission cluster, strains of different MTB sublineages?</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <blockquote class=\"solution\">\n    <solution-title></solution-title>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Yes, it is <strong>possible</strong>. In that scenario, the <strong>same susceptible strain</strong> would <strong>recently</strong>\nhave been transmitted to two patients, and RIF resistance would have evolved <strong>independently</strong> in both.</li>\n      <li>No, by definition. Remember that clustering is based on a threshold that we set of genetic\ndistance measured in SNPs. We want to cluster samples that are genetically so similar that we\ncan consider them as the same genotype, that is to say, as the same strain. Two different\nsublineages, by definition, do not belong to the same genotype and will have a distance in SNPs\nbetween them well beyond any SNP threshold we could use.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>You have learned how to perform a clustering analysis to identify patients that are linked by events of\n<strong>recent transmission</strong>. Clustering analysis is very useful in outbreak investigation and\ncan also be used to describe the emergence and spread of drug-resistance within a population. You have\nalso learned, however, that interpreting clustering results requires careful considerations, given the\nlimitations of the methodology. Clustering analysis is better complemented with phylogenetic analysis,\nwhich may help overcome some of these limitations.</p>\n\n<p>In the following tutorial you will perform a phylogenetic analysis of these same 20 strains.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h1>\n\n<p>You might have noticed that one of the strains analyzed presents thousands of differences (SNPs) to\nthe reference genome, standing out from the rest of strains. This strain is a <em>M. canettii</em> strain,\nthat was actually not part of the outbreak investigated. However we decided to include it here. Why?
