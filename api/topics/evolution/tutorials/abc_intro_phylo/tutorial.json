It includes videos that explore key concepts, written descriptions of each concept, and exercises that demonstrate the methods in action using tools (mostly) available in Galaxy. The exercises are beginner level, but you should know how molecular sequence data is produced and what it looks like. Depending on how you like to learn, you can choose to watch the videos, read the text, work through the exercises, or a combination of the three!</p>\n\n<p>This tutorial is adapted from a 2019 workshop run by the Australian BioCommons and Professor Michael Charleston (University of Tasmania).</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"agenda\">\n  <agenda-title></agenda-title>\n\n  <p>In this tutorial we will deal with:</p>\n\n<ol id=\"markdown-toc\">\n  <li><a href=\"#what-is-a-phylogeny\" id=\"markdown-toc-what-is-a-phylogeny\">What is a Phylogeny?</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#why-we-need-phylogenetics\" id=\"markdown-toc-why-we-need-phylogenetics\">Why we need phylogenetics</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#terminology\" id=\"markdown-toc-terminology\">Terminology</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#building-a-tree\" id=\"markdown-toc-building-a-tree\">Building a tree</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#basic-methodology\" id=\"markdown-toc-basic-methodology\">Basic Methodology</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#calculating-distances\" id=\"markdown-toc-calculating-distances\">Calculating distances</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#lets-build-our-first-tree\" id=\"markdown-toc-lets-build-our-first-tree\">Let’s build our first tree</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#sequence-alignment\" id=\"markdown-toc-sequence-alignment\">Sequence Alignment</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#aligning-sequences-with-mafft\" id=\"markdown-toc-aligning-sequences-with-mafft\">Aligning sequences with MAFFT</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#distance-based-phylogenetic-inference\" id=\"markdown-toc-distance-based-phylogenetic-inference\">Distance-based phylogenetic inference</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#building-a-neighbor-joining-tree\" id=\"markdown-toc-building-a-neighbor-joining-tree\">Building a Neighbor-Joining Tree</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#searching-for-the-best-tree\" id=\"markdown-toc-searching-for-the-best-tree\">Searching for the “best” tree</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#minimum-evolution-me\" id=\"markdown-toc-minimum-evolution-me\">Minimum Evolution (ME)</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#maximum-parsimony-mp-and-parsimony-length\" id=\"markdown-toc-maximum-parsimony-mp-and-parsimony-length\">Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Parsimony Length</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#maximum-likelihood-ml\" id=\"markdown-toc-maximum-likelihood-ml\">Maximum Likelihood (ML)</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#assessing-the-quality-of-trees\" id=\"markdown-toc-assessing-the-quality-of-trees\">Assessing the Quality of trees</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#resolution\" id=\"markdown-toc-resolution\">Resolution</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#bootstrapping\" id=\"markdown-toc-bootstrapping\">Bootstrapping</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#estimating-a-maximum-likelihood-tree-with-iqtree\" id=\"markdown-toc-estimating-a-maximum-likelihood-tree-with-iqtree\">Estimating a Maximum Likelihood tree with IQTree</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#phylogenetic-networks\" id=\"markdown-toc-phylogenetic-networks\">Phylogenetic Networks</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#building-a-neighbor-net-phylogenetic-network\" id=\"markdown-toc-building-a-neighbor-net-phylogenetic-network\">Building a Neighbor-Net phylogenetic network</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"#troubleshooting\" id=\"markdown-toc-troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#summary\" id=\"markdown-toc-summary\">Summary</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#resources\" id=\"markdown-toc-resources\">Resources</a>    <ol>\n      <li><a href=\"#books\" id=\"markdown-toc-books\">Books</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#useful-links\" id=\"markdown-toc-useful-links\">Useful links</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"#how-to-cite-the-tools-used-in-this-tutorial\" id=\"markdown-toc-how-to-cite-the-tools-used-in-this-tutorial\">How to cite the tools used in this tutorial</a></li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n  <p><strong>We will not cover:</strong></p>\n\n  <ul>\n    <li>Workflows from read data to sequences</li>\n    <li>How to get an alignment (much: will use automated methods)</li>\n    <li>Bayesian phylogenetics: MCMC / BEAST / MrBayes</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<!-- Original notes on scope.

The nodes correspond to <strong>taxa</strong>, and the edges, also called <strong>branches</strong>, show the relationships between them, where taxa could be species, or lineages, genera, populations, or even individuals if we are considering something like a genealogy.</p>\n\n<p>Nodes with only one edge attached to them are called <strong>leaves</strong> (or <strong>tips</strong>; in white above) and correspond to taxa with no descendant taxa in the tree. These taxa might be from fossils, or, be currently living, in which case they’re referred to as <strong>extant</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Internal nodes (in lavender above) correspond to hypothetical common ancestors of the extant taxa: the set of descendants that each one has determines the tree.</p>\n\n<p>Many phylogenies have a special node assigned as the common ancestor of all the taxa represented by the leaves in the tree. This node is called the <strong>root</strong> (in blue above). When this is the case, a natural direction is implied from the root to the tips, going forward in time. We call such trees and phylogenies <strong>rooted</strong>; if there is no root, they are called <strong>unrooted</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>The majority of phylogenetic inference methods produce unrooted trees, but rooted trees are more useful.</em></p>\n\n<p>In a rooted phylogeny, all the leaves that are descendant from any given node form a <strong>monophyletic clade</strong>, or often just “<strong>clade</strong>” (monophyletic means “one tribe (of) origin” from the Greek).</p>\n\n<p>One way to determine where the root of a tree belongs is to include an <strong>outgroup</strong> in the data, which is a set of taxa that are definitely not within the clade of interest (which is then called our <strong>ingroup</strong>) but which share a common ancestor with that clade. A good outgroup won’t be too distantly related to our ingroup, because if it’s too distant, choosing where it should connect to the ingroup will be hard, ultimately resulting in a guess.</p>\n\n<p>You can see in the diagram above that the connection of the ingroup to the outgroup could be from multiple locations. Once the unrooted tree is created, using combined data from ingroup and outgroup taxa, we can confidently say that the root is on the branch connecting our ingroup to our outgroup:</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-5\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"images/TreeAnatomyUnrooted.png\" alt=\"A schematic of an unrooted phylogenetic tree.

This means we can use the powerful mathematics of Markov processes.</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>Phylogenetic relationships can be correctly represented by a tree! This isn’t <em>always</em> assumed, but it is very common. Trees are a very attractive representation of evolution, and it is part of our language: “The tree of life” is a common phrase.  However evolution is not always explained by a tree-like, “branching” process as other events such as hybridisation and sharing of genetic material can influence envolutionary processes.</li>\n    <li>The molecular clock assumption is that sequences in a clade evolve at about the same rate. This is known to be wrong, but is useful. For instance, there is variation in evolutionary rate between lineages, but if this variation is not significant, we can ignore it and use simpler models, to better leverage the phylogenetic information in the data.</li>\n    <li>Lineages don’t interact – once they have speciated, they are independent of each other. This isn’t always the case and we know that biological lineages <em>do</em> interact with each other – but our methods are generally not able to manage such complexity. The vast majority of methods make this assumption, particularly if the evolution is also assumed to be tree-like.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"challenges\">Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Phylogenetic Inference is <strong>Hard</strong>.\nOne of the things that make it hard is the sheer number of possible trees that can describe relationships among species.</p>\n\n<p>The number of rooted binary trees grows as 1, 3, 15, 105, 945, 10395… in fact the formula for this number for \\(n\\) taxa (we use `taxa’ in general, since not all phylogenetic inference is at the species level) is \\((2n-3)!! = (2n-3)(2n-5)...(3)(1),\\) which grows as fast as \\(2^{n}n!\\).</p>\n\n<p>The table below gives you an idea of the scale we are dealing with.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Number of Unrooted Binary Trees</em></p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><em>n</em></th>\n      <th># trees</th>\n      <th>notes</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>\\(3\\)</td>\n      <td>trivial to check</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>\\(15\\)</td>\n      <td>enumerable by hand</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>\\(105\\)</td>\n      <td>enumerable by hand on a rainy day</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>\\(945\\)</td>\n      <td>enumerable by hand during lockdown</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>\\(10395\\)</td>\n      <td>easily searched by computer</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>\\(135135\\)</td>\n      <td>a bit more than the number of hairs on your head</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>9</td>\n      <td>\\(2027025\\)</td>\n      <td>population of Sydney living west of Paramatta</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>\\(34459425\\)</td>\n      <td>comparable with the number of possible tickets in a typical lottery</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>\\(\\approx 8.2\\times 10^{21}\\)</td>\n      <td>getting slow for computers even with branch-and-bound</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>48</td>\n      <td>\\(\\approx 3.21\\times 10^{70}\\)</td>\n      <td>number of particles in the universe-ish</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>136</td>\n      <td>\\(\\approx 2.11\\times 10^{267}\\)</td>\n      <td>number of trees to choose from in the first “Out of Africa” data set</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"calculating-distances\">Calculating distances</h2>\n\n<p>Building a tree begins with a set of <em>distances</em>, which record how different the taxa are from each other.\nDistances have very desirable properties, that can be summarised as follows: for any objects \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), writing \\(d(x,y)\\) means the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) etc.  These properties are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>non-negativity</em> – distances can never be negative, and in fact we treat two things as identical if they have a distance of 0 between them.</li>\n  <li><em>symmetry</em> – the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) is the same as the distance from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\); that is, \\(d(x,y) = d(y,x)\\).</li>\n  <li>the <em>triangle inequality</em> – there are no short-cuts!  The distance from \\(x\\) to \\(z\\) is always <em>at most</em> the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) plus that from \\(y\\) to \\(z\\); that is, \\(d(x,y) + d(y,z) \\leq d(x,z)\\).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In phylogenetics terms, we like distances to represent something like time and we can assign lengths to branches (see the <a href=\"#figure-4\">Tree Anatomy diagram</a> above).</p>\n\n<p>Distances can be calculated based on a variety of data.

The most commonly used kind of data in modern phylogenetics is <em>aligned molecular sequences</em> – typically, DNA, RNA, or Amino Acids (AA) from equivalent (homologous) genes in the species of interest. We focus on this form of molecular phylogenetics in this tutorial.</p>\n\n<p>Other input data forms are distances or dissimilarity measures based on molecular-based measures like DNA-DNA hybridisation, gene presence/absence, and morphology (physical dimensions). We will not discuss this kind of data in this tutorial.</p>\n\n<p>Aligned sequences can be converted into distances (green box above), using models for how the sites (i.e. specific nucleotides or amino acids) have evolved.\nThese distances can be expressed as a matrix <em>D</em>, which becomes the input for distance-based methods.</p>\n\n<p>Distance-based methods (orange boxes) use algorithms to select a pair of taxa, or clades, to join together to make a new clade.

Although it is quite accurate and fast, there are other fast methods that can be then applied to modify the NJ tree and create a better one.</p>\n\n<p>The FastTree2 program that we are using does this. First it creates a “rough” NJ tree, and then modifies it to optimise a quantity called <em>Minimum Evolution</em> (ME) (more on this later).

During neighbor joining, FastTree stores profiles of internal nodes instead of a distance matrix, which reduces the memory required. FastTree uses a combination of three heuristics to speed up this phase: it remembers the best join for each node, as in fast neighbor-joining; it does a hill-climbing search for better joins from a candidate join, as in relaxed neighbor joining; and it uses the \"top hits\" heuristic to avoid computing all pairwise distances and to avoid considering all possible joins at every step. It also updates the best join for a node as it comes across them, which reduces the amount of hill-climbing. Another limitation of FastTree's neighbor-joining phase is that it does not correct the distances for multiple substitutions, which exacerbates long-branch attraction. However, this will be corrected in the next stage.\n>\n>**Minimum Evolution**\n>\n>FastTree then tries to reduce the length of the tree, using a mix of nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and subtree-prune-regraft moves (SPRs). These \"balanced minimum-evolution\" rearrangements are roughly the same as what FastME does, but because FastTree uses profiles instead of distances, it is much faster. By default, FastTree uses 4*log<sub>2</sub>(N) rounds of nearest-neighbor interchanges and 2 rounds of subtree-prune-regraft moves. In each round, it considers every possible NNI in the tree. Because there are too many (O(N<sup>2</sup>)) possible SPR moves, FastTree treats SPR moves as chains of NNIs and only extends the best choice in the chain for chains of length two or greater. In the minimum-evolution framework, if the distances are not too noisy, NNI and SPR moves suffice to reach optimal trees (Desper & Gascuel 2004, Bordewich et al. 2009).\n>\n>Distances: During these minimum evolution steps, FastTree needs to estimate distances between sequences or profiles. For protein sequences, FastTree estimates distances by using the BLOSUM45 amino acid similarity matrix, and it corrects for multiple substitutions by using the formula $-1.3 \\times \\log(1-d)$, where $d$ is weighted so that random sequences have an average value of 1. For nucleotide sequences, FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor distance $-0.75\\times\\log(1 - \\frac{4}{3} d)$, where $d$ is the proportion of positions that differ. When comparing two sequences, positions with gaps are ignored; when comparing two profiles, positions are weighted by their proportions of non-gaps.\n>\n{: .comment} -->\n\n<p>It won’t take very long for FastTree to build your tree.\nBut when it’s done, how can you see it?</p>\n\n<p>Clicking on the ‘eye’ icon  <i class=\"far fa-eye\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">galaxy-eye</span> of the output doesn’t at first appear to be very illuminating: it’s just a parenthesised list of taxon names and numbers.\nThis is <strong>Newick Format</strong>, and it’s worth knowing at least a little of what it means.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Each matched pair of parentheses denotes a <strong>cluster</strong> or <strong>subtree</strong>: “(A,B)” means that A and B are each others’ closest relatives (also called <em>sister taxa</em>).</li>\n  <li>A number after a cluster (so, after a closing parenthesis) is a <strong>label</strong> for that cluster.

But finding the tree that minimises this score is still computationally intractable, because the space of trees is so huge.</p>\n\n<p>The Maximum Parsimony method for finding the “best” tree is to search tree space for the tree (or trees) that <em>minimises</em> the parsimony length of any tree for that alignment.

However, it is <em>proportional</em> to the probability that the tree is correct, out of the set of possible trees and models you are considering.</p>\n\n<p>One major, almost ubiquitous, assumption about molecular sequence data is that each site evolves independently of all other sites. Biologically, this isn’t always the case, but in practice, this makes things much more tractable, and we still have a good chance of getting the tree(s) right.</p>\n\n<p>Another assumption we make is that the substitution rate – the rate at which changes of nucleotide at a given position in the sequence happen – is only dependent on the current state, i.e., we do not care about how a sequence came to be what it is, only what the sequence is now, to determine what are the probable evolutions of it.\nThis seems much more biologically reasonable and makes this into a Markov process, which in turn enables a lot of calculations to be made simply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"searching-for-trees-and-their-branch-lengths\">Searching for trees and their branch lengths</h3>\n\n<p>When dealing with nucleotides A, C, G, T, there are 4x4 rate matrices with different names: Jukes-Cantor (JC69) with one parameter, Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY85) with five parameters, and many more, that define the rates at which nucleotides change.\nThere are other 20x20 matrices for amino acids, and even 64x64 matrices for codons.</p>\n\n<p>To convert from a rate to a probability, hence giving us a likelihood, requires that we have a branch length. Then, we can calculate the probability under a given model, and after a specific time interval, of going from one nucleotide to another. We multiply these site probabilities to calculate the probability of going from an entire sequence to another.\nThus, looking for the optimal tree under likelihood requires we also search for the best-fit <strong>branch lengths</strong>, as well as looking for the best <strong>tree</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Maximum Likelihood is therefore the <strong>slowest</strong> tree inference method we discuss in this tutorial.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"models-of-sequence-evolution\">Models of sequence evolution</h3>\n\n<p><em>If you are in a hurry to do the phylogenetic analysis you can skip this section and go to the next <a href=\"#estimating-a-maximum-likelihood-tree-with-iqtree\">Hands-on: running IQ Tree</a>.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"details\">\n  <details-title>Likelihood models</details-title>\n  <p>Likelihood is based on probability, so requires we choose a probabilistic model for the evolution of sequences.\nThe simplest model for DNA is that each nucleotide has the same rate of change, and that all nucleotides appear with equal frequency (called the base frequencies) of 25%, 25%, 25%, 25%. This is the Jukes-Cantor (JC69) model published in 1969, and this model has just one parameter.</p>\n\n  <p>More biological realism allows for different nucleotide proportions outside the uniform 25% rate. This is the Felsenstein 1981 model, known as F81, and it has three more parameters for the rates (not four: given the first three base frequencies, this defines the other one).</p>\n\n  <p>A next level of sophistication is the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model (HKY85) published in 1985, which acknowledges that transitions (changes of state within the purines A, G or within the pyrimidines C, T) occur more readily than transversions (changes from purine to pyrimidine or vice versa).\nHence the HKY85 model has an additional parameter of these different types of subtitution: it can be represented by the substitution rate matrix below:<!-- <figure id=\"figure-13\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/HKY85RateMatrix.png\"  alt=\"HKY85 Formula. \"  width=\"300px\" width=\"1367\" height=400 loading=\"lazy\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/HKY85RateMatrix.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br/><br/><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 13</strong>:</span> HKY85 rate matrix</figcaption></figure>--><br />\n<br />\n\\(Q_{HKY} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c@{ }c@{ }c@{ }c}\n\\ * &amp; \\kappa\\pi_{G} &amp; \\pi_{C} &amp; \\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\kappa\\pi_{A} &amp; * &amp; \\pi_{C} &amp; \\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\pi_{A} &amp; \\pi_{G} &amp; * &amp; \\kappa\\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\pi_{A} &amp; \\pi_{G} &amp; \\kappa\\pi_{C} &amp; * \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\\)</p>\n\n  <p><br />\nIn the above, the \\(\\pi\\) symbol is used for the base frequencies, and a \\(\\kappa\\) symbol is used for the transition/transversion ratio parameter.  The asterisk “*” is a short-hand to mean “the sum of everything else in the row.”</p>\n\n  <p>A more general model still is the <em>General Time-Reversible</em> model (GTR), in which each substitution type has its own rate.  It still keeps the property that a substitution from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) has the same probability as one from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\) (this comes from the “reversible” property) but otherwise all rates are independent of each other:<!-- <figure id=\"figure-14\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/GTRRateMatrix.png\"  alt=\"GTR. \"  width=\"300px\" width=\"1358\" height=400 loading=\"lazy\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/GTRRateMatrix.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br/><br/><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 14</strong>:</span> GTR rate matrix</figcaption></figure>--><br />\n<br />\n\\(Q_{GTR} = \\left[\\begin{array}{c@{ }c@{ }c@{ }c}\n\\ * &amp; \\alpha\\pi_{G} &amp; \\beta\\pi_{C} &amp; \\gamma\\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\alpha\\pi_{A} &amp; * &amp; \\delta\\pi_{C} &amp; \\epsilon\\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\beta\\pi_{A} &amp; \\delta\\pi_{G} &amp; * &amp; \\eta\\pi_{T} \\\\\n\\gamma\\pi_{A} &amp; \\epsilon\\pi_{G} &amp; \\eta\\pi_{C} &amp; * \\\\\n\\end{array}\\right]\\)</p>\n\n  <p><br />\nA further level of sophistication is the recognition that some sites may be constrained from changing at all. For example, there may be some that have a critical role in fixing the correct amino acid for a protein to function. This addition to the above methods is known as “invariable” sites and is usually represented by a “+I” appended to the model name.</p>\n\n  <p>The last level of sophistication is that some sites may evolve faster than others, even if they are under the same kind of model with the same parameters in the matrix \\(Q\\).\nThe most common way to allow for this is to imagine that the relative rate for a particular site is drawn from a Gamma \\(\\Gamma\\) probability distribution, which has some nice properties like allowing most sites to change very slowly and permitting some to change rapidly.\nThis is usually denoted by a “+\\(\\Gamma\\)” or “+G” appended to the model name.</p>\n\n  <p>There are <strong>many</strong> more models, with many more parameters and constraints.  Finding the best one to fit a data set is a complex task!</p>\n\n  <p>Fortunately there are tools that help determine the most appropriate model for a given data set, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and some variations of that.</p>\n\n  <p>The program IQTree, which we use later, performs a step to determine which model is most appropriate for your data set, based on AIC and other schemes to avoid over-fitting while still having as good a fit to your data as possible.\nIn that step, trees, and their likelihoods based on your data, are estimated for many different models. Each yields a likelihood score but rather than simply take the model that maximises the likelihood, over-complex models are penalised, to avoid over-fitting. One such penalty function is the AIC; there are others.</p>\n\n  <p>There are whole books describing this process, and it’s clearly well beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into such depth, but now you should have some appreciation of what is going on behind the scenes when an Maximum Likelihood method is looking for the best model for your data.</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1 id=\"assessing-the-quality-of-trees\">Assessing the Quality of trees</h1>\n\n<p>A tree-building method will, of course, build you a tree.</p>\n\n<p>But what if your data are not even <em>from</em> a tree?  Or, what if the data are from sequences that are so distantly related that they are virtually independent of each other and are essentially random?</p>\n\n<p>It is important that, once you have estimated a tree, you assess how reliable it is.</p>\n\n<p>Remember that a phylogeny is a <em>collection of hypotheses of relatedness</em>. Each branch separates some of the taxa from the others, and if the branch is above a subtree it corresponds to a hypothesis that the taxa in that subtree are <em>monophyletic</em> with respect to the other taxa in the rest of the tree (as shown in <a href=\"#figure-1\">Figure 1</a>.).</p>\n\n<p>This means that it is meaningful to assess the reliability of <em>branches</em> of your tree, in addition to just assessing it overall.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"resolution\">Resolution</h2>\n\n<p>A good phylogenetic tree is one that is <em>well resolved</em> – that is, every time a lineage branches, it forms two new branches.\nEquivalently, every internal node has three edges touching it.</p>\n\n<p>An unresolved node <em>may</em> be a true representation of the branching pattern of a group of lineages. For example, this is generally the case for very rapid diversification, such as during an island radiation (species arrives in new place with lots of niches; diversifies incredibly quickly).</p>\n\n<p>In phylogenetics unresolved nodes are more often due to a lack of resolving power in the data, so the phylogenetic method cannot choose the branch ordering:</p>\n\n<figure id=\"figure-15\" style=\"max-width: 90%;\"><img src=\"./images/Unresolved.png\" alt=\"Four simple phylogenetic trees composed of three taxa (A, B, C) at the bottom that are connected to a common ancestor at the top. The first three trees group the taxa into two clades but differ in the branching patterns. Arrows indicate that they are so similar that there is not enough information to choose between them. The fourth tree is ‘unresolved’ where taxa A, B, C remain in a single clade derived from a common ancestor.\" width=\"643\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"./images/Unresolved.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><small>Open image in new tab</small></a><br /><br /><figcaption><span class=\"figcaption-prefix\"><strong>Figure 15</strong>:</span> Unresolved nodes</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>If there are many unresolved branches in the phylogeny, this is an indication that there is not enough information in your data: you’ll need to obtain more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bootstrapping\">Bootstrapping</h2>\n\n<p>A very common (and useful) method for dealing with unresolved branches is called <em>bootstrapping</em>, which is a technique that has a solid basis in statistics (not just phylogenetics). The idea is that one resamples with a replacement data set to create a “pseudoreplicate” that is analysed in the same way as the original data. This process is then repeated many times to create a distribution. Bootstrapping is known to be a is a good way to measure the internal consistency of a data set, and its use in phylogenetics is well established.</p>\n\n<p>The naive method for bootstrapping is called “non-parametric” and works by effectively resampling the patterns at each site in the alignment, creating a pseudo-alignment of the same total number of sites, then re-building the tree.</p>\n\n<p>IQTree has a very - <em>ultra</em> - fast bootstrapping method that is cleverer and works a bit better than the naive method. When we use IQTree in the next part of the tutorial, we will also do bootstrapping on the tree.  See <span class=\"citation\"><a href=\"#10.1093/molbev/msaa015\">Minh <i>et al.</i> 2020</a></span> for details on the method.</p>\n\n<p>Bootstrapping can be done on any inference method. We will use the likelihood method that searches for the tree and branch lengths that maximises the likelihood for (1) our actual data, and then (2) for each of the pseudoreplicates, noting for each of these which branches occur in the best trees found.</p>\n\n<p>By keeping track of which branches occur in the best trees found for each of the pseudoreplicates, we can note how often the branches in the best tree for our <em>actual</em> data occur in the resampled data.  If they occur a lot – say, 80% of the time or more – then we can be fairly sure that that branch is well supported by the data.</p>\n\n<p>Bootstrap values therefore appear for each branch, and are most often expressed as a percentage or proportion. Branches at the leaves that occur in every possible tree so these would get 100% bootstrap values every time, and don’t tell us anything.</p>\n\n<p>(Note: FastTree does not do bootstrapping natively, but can in conjuction with other tools (<a href=\"http://meta.microbesonline.org/fasttree/\">see details</a>). It’s fiddly to do this so we will not try it in this tutorial.)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"estimating-a-maximum-likelihood-tree-with-iqtree\">Estimating a Maximum Likelihood tree with IQTree</h2>\n\n<p>IQTree is a state-of-the-art cross-platform program that uses maximum likelihood to find optimal phylogenetic trees.\nIt can perform model selection and bootstrapping.\nAnd it’s on Galaxy!</p>\n\n<p>While this is running you might use your time to read the <a href=\"#models-of-sequence-evolution\">Models of sequence evolution</a> and <a href=\"#bootstrapping\">Bootstrapping</a> sections above.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"hands_on\">\n  <hands-on-title>Estimating a Maximum Likelihood tree with IQTree</hands-on-title>\n\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <p>Find the <span class=\"tool\" data-tool=\"toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/iqtree/iqtree/2.1.2+galaxy2\" title=\"IQTree tool\" aria-role=\"button\"><i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> <strong>IQTree</strong> (<i class=\"fas fa-cubes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> Galaxy version 2.1.2+galaxy2)</span> program in the tool finder, and run it with the following parameters:</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>In <em>“General options”</em>:\n          <ul>\n            <li><i class=\"far fa-file\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">param-file</span> <em>“Specify input alignment file in PHYLIP, FASTA, NEXUS, CLUSTAL or MSF format.”</em>: your aligned sequence data (output of <strong>MAFFT</strong> <i class=\"fas fa-wrench\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i><span class=\"visually-hidden\">tool</span>)</li>\n            <li><em>“Specify sequence type as either of DNA, AA, BIN, MORPH, CODON or NT2AA for DNA, amino-acid, binary, morphological, codon or DNA-to-AA-translated sequences”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">DNA</code></li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>In <em>“Modelling Parameters”</em>:\n          <ul>\n            <li>In <em>“Rate heterogeneity”</em>:\n              <ul>\n                <li><em>“Write maximum likelihood site ratios to .mlrate file”</em>: Yes</li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li>In <em>“Bootstrap Parameters”</em>:\n          <ul>\n            <li>In <em>“Ultrafast bootstrap parameters”</em>:\n              <ul>\n                <li><em>“Specify number of bootstrap replicates (&gt;=1000).”</em>: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">1000</code></li>\n              </ul>\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <!-- > 4.

Instead you can start with a <em>phylogenetic network</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Phylogenetic networks have two purposes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>to show an estimate of the evolutionary history that is not strictly branching, so, involving horizontal gene transfer or hybridisation events.</p>\n\n    <p>or</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>to show conflicting phylogenetic signal in the data set, suggesting different possible trees.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In this tutorial we use networks for the second purpose because we are working under the assumption that there is a true tree, which is the actual evolutionary history of our species of interest.</p>\n\n<p>To understand what this kind of phylogenetic network is, and how to interpret one, we need to think about what the branches of a tree <em>do</em>. Branches <em>split</em> the taxa into two groups: those on one side of the branch, and those on the other. We are thinking about unrooted trees in this context, so the two branches coming from the root constitute a single split.</p>\n\n<p>Thus every branch of a tree can be thought of as a <em>split</em> and a tree is a collection of <em>compatible</em> splits: where by “compatible” we just mean that they can be on the same tree.</p>\n\n<p>So our tree search is an attempt to find a “best” set of <em>splits</em> that are all compatible, and which together explain the evolutionary relationships among the taxa of interest.</p>\n\n<p>However, the data may support multiple splits that are <em>not</em> compatible. For example, we might have a set of nucleotide sequence data like this:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"./images/tableOfSitesForSplits.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"./images/tableOfSitesForSplits.png\" alt=\"A table displaying DNA sequences for four different taxa.

Singleton: Displays unique sequences specific to each taxon at sites 5-8; 12|34: Displays differences in the sequence at sites 9-12; 23|14: Displays differences the sequence at sites 13 and 14; 13|24: Displays differences in sequence at site 15.\" width=\"2245\" height=\"505\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a></p>\n\n<!-- | Taxon | Sequence          | constant | singleton | 12,34  | 23,14 | 13,24 |\n| ----- | ----------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| 1     | `ACTGAGTTAGGTCTA` | `ACTG`   | `AGTT`    | `AGGT` | `CT`  | `A`   |\n| 2     | `ACTGCTTTAGGTTGC` | `ACTG`   | `CTTT`    | `AGGT` | `TG`  | `C`   |\n| 3     | `ACTGCGCTGCACTGA` | `ACTG`   | `CGCT`    | `GCAC` | `TG`  | `A`   |\n| 4     | `ACTGCGTAGCCGAAG` | `ACTG`   | `CGTA`    | `GCCG` | `AA`  | `G`   |\n|       | ----------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| Site: | `123456789012345` | `1234`   | `5678`    | `9012` | `34`  | `5`   |\n|       | `         1     ` |          |           | ` 1  ` |       |       | -->\n\n<p>In this table the sequence is listed in full in the second column, then broken up into different categories in subsequent columns.</p>\n\n<p>The first four sites are <em>constant</em>, so don’t tell us anything much about the phylogeny.</p>\n\n<p>The next four <em>singleton</em> sites segregate one taxon from the others (which is again not terribly useful in terms of resolving the branching in the phylogeny).</p>\n\n<p>The so-called “parsimony informative” sites start at site 9.

A phylogenetic tree provides a best estimate of the evolutionary relationships between species (taxa) of interest, which is the framework we need to compare them.</p>\n\n<p>A key component of molecular phylogenetics is creating an alignment – this is a complex process that can have different outcomes using different methods. It is always a good idea to look at the alignment to see if it makes sense: has the alignment program included the insertion/deletion events which are consistent with a phylogenetic relationship between the species?</p>\n\n<p>While estimating phylogenetic trees is computationally challenging, there are a range of well-validated methods to use, constructing them based on distances, molecular sequences, and other data; these can also be used to create phylogenetic networks that represent the complexities in the data. There is an extensive range of scoring functions by which we can compare trees, including: Minimum total distance (minimum evolution); the maximum amount of evolutionary “work” to account for the data (maximum parsimony); or by finding the model that has the highest probability of giving us the data we saw (maximum likelihood).</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to remember that these are all statistical estimates, so they may differ, and it is good advice to use multiple methods to confirm general phylogenetic relationships rather than choose a single method.</p>\n\n<p>We can use Bootstrapping to calculate a measure of confidence for clades in trees based on molecular sequences. Bootstrapping involves representative independent re-samples of the input alignment which are analysed again using the same methods, 100s to 1000s of times, to gauge how reliable each branch is, in the sense of how often the branch is part of the best tree found for each re-sample. This isn’t a measure of confidence in the statistical sense, but a rule of thumb of 80% or more being “good support” is common in the literature – remembering that as sequences get longer and longer, bootstrap support values go up, no matter how poor the data are!</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that this tutorial is only focusing on the estimation of individual best trees rather than taking a Bayesian approach in which a posterior probability of trees is created, using programs like <a href=\"https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/index.html\">MyBayes</a> or <a href=\"http://www.beast2.org\">BEAST</a>. These programs use even more computational resources and can run for many days or weeks as they wander around “tree space”, building up a representative distribution of the probability that each tree is “right”. This computational burden is one of the main reasons we have not gone into Bayesian methods in this tutorial. Still, many good examples are available online on the web pages for the above programs.</p>\n\n<p>We hope that this tutorial and accompanying videos have given you a better understanding of the principles of phylogenetics and how these methods work, which will help you make informed decisions about the phylogenetic analyses you perform.</p>\n\n<p>See the resources below to learn more about phylogenetics.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"resources\">Resources</h1>\n<p>To develop a deeper understanding of phylogenetic trees, there is no better way than estimating phylogenies yourself — and work through a book on the topic at your own pace.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"books\">Books</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Phylogenetics in the genomics era</em>, 2020.
