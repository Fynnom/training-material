For example, you have to follow the bioimage.io model Resource Description File Specification with a certain format version.\nThe model is expected to be cross-compatible among the consumer software. It also should be well documented and, of course, it has to be public and can be used by anyone unde the chosen licensing conditions.\n---\n\n## Model contribution guidelines\n\n1. Create a BioImage.IO model\n2. Upload the model to the BioImage Model Zoo\n\n???\nTo contribute with a model to the BioImage Model Zoo you will only need to follow two steps. Let's see them closely!\n---\n\n### Create a BioImage.IO model\n\nTwo steps:\n1. Choose one way to create your model (automatically or manually)\n2. Check that the model is correctly created\n\n???\nFirstly, you will need to create a Bioimage.io model. To do so, you will need to create the model and check that it is correct. To create the model, you will have to choose if you want to do it automatically or manually. After that, you will have to check that the model is correctly created.\n---\n\n#### Create a BioImage.IO model: Create your model\n\n* Automatic export of the model using the [bioimage.core python library](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) (recomended). Example code [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/example/model_creation.ipynb).\n* The main function to build the model is `bioimageio.core.build_model`\n* Manual generation of the model.\n* Creating the [BioImage.IO Model Resource Description File Specifications](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/bioimageio_model_spec) (rdf.yaml file)\n* Some examples can be found on the Bioimage Model Zoo webpage.\n\n???\nWhen creating your model, the first step would consist in choosing how to create this model: you can either do an automatic expoert of the model using the bioimageio.core python library (the recommended option with an example code available) or to generate the model manually.\nIf you choose to do it manually, you will have to create the r d f . yaml file where there exist mandatory or optional fields on it. In the Bioimage Model Zoo webpage you can find different examples.\n---\n\n#### Create a BioImage.IO model: Check that the model is correctly created\n\n* Static Validation of the model format using the bioimage.core python library\n```\nbioimageio validate /../rdf.yaml\n```\n* Dynamic Validation of the model's deployment\n```\nbioimageio test-model --weights tensorflow_saved_model_bundle --device cpu /.../rdf.yaml\n```\n\n???\nThen, you will need to check that the model is correctly created. To do so, you should perform a static and dynamic validation of the model format by executing those commands in the terminal.\n---\n\n### Upload the model to the BioImage Model Zoo\n\nIn the bioimage.IO click on the Upload button.\n\n<a href=\"../../images/contribute_model.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/contribute_model.png\"  alt=\"Contribute Models. \"  width=\"1696\" height=732 loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n\n???\nNow it is time to upload your crated model through several new steps that you need to follow.\n---\n\n#### Upload the model: Log in to Zenodo\n\nLog in to Zenodo and give access to the BioEngine application.\n\n<a href=\"../../images/contribute_model.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/contribute_model.png\"  alt=\"Contribute Models. \"  width=\"1696\" height=732 loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n\n???\nThe first step will be to log in to Zenodo and give access to the BioEngine application. You will see an automatic message once you are logged in. If not, refresh the page. This step needs to be done only for the first time you upload a model.\n---\n\n#### Upload your model: Upload your model RDF\n\n<a href=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_1.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_1.png\"  alt=\"Contribute Models-Upload model rdf. \"  width=\"964\" height=734 loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n\n???\nThe second step will be to upload your model r d f as you see in the image.\n---\n\n#### Upload your model: Complete fields\n\n<a href=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_2.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_2.png\"  alt=\"Contribute Models-Complete Fields. \"  width=\"941\" height=794 loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n\n???\nThen you will have to complete all the missing fields as in the image shown here.\n---\n\n#### Upload your model: Complete fields\n\n<a href=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_3.png\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"../../images/contribute_model_upload_3.png\"  alt=\"Contribute Models-Complete Fields. \"  width=\"936\" height=866 loading=\"lazy\"></a>\n\n???\nAnd here.\n---\n\n#### Upload your model: pull request\n\n1. A [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/collection-bioimage-io/pulls/bioimageiobot) will be generated\n2. Continious Integration (CI) workflow test\n3. Review by a maintainer from the BioImage.IO terminal\n\n???\nA pull request (PR) is generated (this process may take some minutes). In the PR, the model is tested by a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for its technical correctness. and reviewed by a maintainer from the BioImage.IO team. This PR is aimed for further discussions between model contributors and the BioImage.IO team.\n---\n\n#### Upload your model: you are done!\n\nIf everything went as it should be, your model will be uploaded and displayed in the webpage!\n\n???\nOnce the model passes all checks and has the approval of a maintainer, it will be added to the BioImage.IO collection and displayed in the webpage (this process may take some minutes).\n---\n\n## Additional information\n\n* [How to get most of your model documentation](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/contribute_models/README?id=how-to-get-most-of-your-model-documentation)\n* [Considerations for the model description file](https://bioimage.io/docs/#/contribute_models/README?id=considerations-for-the-model-description-file-format_versiongt030)\n\n???\nRemember that you can always read our documentation or additional information on this topic or others in our resources.\nFor example, you could check how to get most of your model documentation and considerations for the model description file.\n---\n"],"hands_on":false,"slides":true,"mod_date":"2023-05-23 19:32:49 +0000","pub_date":"2023-05-18 09:44:06 +0000","version":4,"api":"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/api/topics/ai4life/tutorials/contribute-materials/tutorial.json","tools":[],"supported_servers":{"exact":[],"inexact":[{"name":"UseGalaxy.eu","url":"https://usegalaxy.eu","id":"eu","human":"Galaxy Europe","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org","url":"https://usegalaxy.org","id":"us","human":"Galaxy Main","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.org.au","url":"https://usegalaxy.org.au","id":"au","human":"Galaxy Australia","usegalaxy":true},{"name":"UseGalaxy.fr","url":"https://usegalaxy.fr","id":"fr","human":"Galaxy France","usegalaxy":true}]},"topic_name_human":"Image analysis using Deep Learning","admin_install":{"install_tool_dependencies":true,"install_repository_dependencies":true,"install_resolver_dependencies":true,"tools":[]},"admin_install_yaml":"---\ninstall_tool_dependencies: true\ninstall_repository_dependencies: true\ninstall_resolver_dependencies: true\ntools: []\n","tours":false,"slides_recordings":false,"translations":{"tutorial":[],"slides":[],"video":true},"license":"CC-BY-4.0","type":"tutorial","redirect_from":["/short/ai4life/contribute-materials/slides","/short/S00107"]}
